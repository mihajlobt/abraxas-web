                                    third party) with regard to your relationship with Abraxas, including without limitation
                                    disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of this Site, and/or rights of privacy
                                    and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American
                                    Arbitration Association’s rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and
                                    Abraxas hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your

                                    bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor Abraxas will participate in a

                                    Abraxas is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed
                                    by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American Arbitration Association is
                                    unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and eighty (180) days of
                                    filing the case, then either Abraxas or you can elect to have the arbitration
                                    administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the
                                    award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent
                                    jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not
                                    have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of
                                    Use.

                                    with Abraxas must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim

                                Texas, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. Furthermore, you agree
                                to use this Site and otherwise interact with Abraxas based in principles of good faith and
                                fair dealing. If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for
                                any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then
                                that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the
                                validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Abraxas’s failure to insist upon or
                                enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver
                                of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or
                                continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition. Abraxas reserves
                                the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply
                                to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment. This dispute resolution
                                provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Abraxas.

                                or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Abraxas. Any purported

                                will be null and void. Abraxas may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without
                                your consent. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent
                                jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that
