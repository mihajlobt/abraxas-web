The Indemnitor shall promptly assume control of the defense and shall employ counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to handle and defend the same, at the Indemnitor’s sole cost and expense. The Indemnitee may participate in and observe the proceedings at its own cost and expense with counsel of its own choosing. The Indemnitor shall not settle any Action on any terms or in any manner that adversely affects the rights of any Indemnitee without the Indemnitee’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the Indemnitor fails or refuses to assume control of the defense of such Action, the Indemnitee shall have the right, but no obligation, to defend against such Action, including settling such Action after giving notice to the Indemnitor, in each case in such manner and on such terms as the Indemnitee may deem appropriate. The Indemnitor’s failure to perform any obligations under this Section 12.3 will relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations under this Section 12, except to the extent that the Indemnitor can demonstrate that it has been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.
