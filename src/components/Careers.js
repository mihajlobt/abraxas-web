                            In a town like Austin, with a slogan of “Keeping it Weird”, it’s hard to go anywhere that is not
                            filled with hungry people. Nobody is hungrier or more motivated than us at Abraxas Technology. We love
                            what we do, we love building products, and we’re very good at both of them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We’re looking for someone who is as hungry as us. Someone who has been in enterprise sales.
                            Someone who has been a Media Buyer in a previous company. Someone who knows what ABC stands
                            for and is ready to work hard (so that they are rewarded greatly). If you’ve worked in the Out
                            of Home industry, that’s a huge plus. But at the end of the day, if you’re hungry and hate to lose, we want to interview you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lastly, you love a challenge and are looking for that opportunity to put your mark on in this world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If all of this applies to you, you might just be exactly the type of person we are looking for.
                        </p>
