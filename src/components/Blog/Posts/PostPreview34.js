                <p>In a town like Austin, with a slogan of “Keeping it Weird”, it’s hard to go anywhere that is not filled with creative people with an eye for design. That is, except when you come to our offices at Abraxas Technology. We love marketing, we love building products, and we’re very good at both of them, but when it comes to creativity, we’re lucky if we can match grey tones which white tones when painting a room.</p>
                <p>That’s where you come in. You love design. You love representing information in a way that is palatable, enjoyable, and easily understandable. You can code and while some people outside of software development would say that you are a developer, you consider yourself to be first and foremost a designer.</p>
                <p>Lastly, you love a challenge and are looking for that opportunity to put your mark on a product by taking what backend developers have done and building the front end. You have a portfolio of previous sites and products that you have either contributed to or built yourself.</p>
                <p>If all of this applies to you, you might just be exactly the type of person we are looking for.</p>
                <p>Responsibilities</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Help form project conceptions</li>
                    <li>Prototype concepts (software)</li>
                    <li>Work in teams both internal (engineering) and external (marketing &amp; sales)</li>
                    <li>Contribute to product specifications</li>
                    <li>Learn and apply user-centered design principles</li>
                    <li>Design site interface and graphics</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><em>Due to a huge response, we are currently going through resumes and scheduling interviews. We will try and respond to all resumes that we receive, but for the time being we will need to close the job requirement.&nbsp;</em></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><em>Abraxas Technology is committed to the principle of equal employment opportunity for all employees and to providing employees with a work environment free of discrimination and harassment.
