                <p>In a town like Austin, with a slogan of “Keeping it Weird”, it’s hard to go anywhere that is not filled with hungry people.&nbsp; Nobody is hungrier or more motivated than us at Abraxas Technology. We love what we do, we love building products, and we’re very good at both of them.</p>
                <p>We’re looking for someone who is as hungry as us. Someone who has been in enterprise sales. Someone who has been a Media Buyer in a previous company. Someone who knows what ABC stands for and is ready to work hard (so that they are rewarded greatly). If you’ve worked in the Out of Home industry that’s a huge plus. But at the end of the day, if you’re hungry and hate to lose we want to interview you.</p>
                <p>Lastly, you love a challenge and are looking for that opportunity to put your mark on in this world.</p>
                <p>If all of this applies to you, you might just be exactly the type of person we are looking for.</p>
                <p>Responsibilities</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Present, promote and sell products/services using solid arguments to existing and prospective customers,</li>
                    <li>Perform cost-benefit and needs analysis of existing/potential customers to meet their needs,</li>
                    <li>Establish, develop and maintain positive business and customer relationships,</li>
                    <li>Reach out to customer leads through cold calling,</li>
                    <li>Expedite the resolution of customer problems and complaints to maximize satisfaction,</li>
                    <li>Achieve agreed upon sales targets and outcomes within schedule,</li>
                    <li>Coordinate sales effort with team members and other departments,</li>
                    <li>Analyze market’s potential, track sales and status reports,</li>
                    <li>Supply management with reports on customer needs, problems, interests, competitive&nbsp;activities, and potential for new products and services,</li>
                    <li>Keep abreast of best practices and promotional trends,</li>
                    <li>Continuously improve through feedback.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you’re hungry and you think that you’d be a good fit, send an email with your resume and LinkedIn profile to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:JLawton@abraxastechnology.com">JLawton@abraxastechnology.com</a> and <a href="mailto:J.Gilfus@abraxastechnology.com">J.Gilfus@abraxastechnology.com&nbsp;</a>.</p>
