                <p>ABRAXAS Technology is bringing real-time metrics to the world of outdoor advertising. Our technology allows advertisers to measure how many people viewed their advertisement and when, by passively collecting and aggregating each digital signature that passes within its vicinity. For the first time, we can measure the return on investment of outdoor advertisements.</p>
                <p>I was recently described by <a href="http://www.nibletz.com/events/austin-startup-week/bunker-labs-Abraxas">Nibletz</a> as “not your typical adman,” and that is an accurate depiction. When I left the Army, there was not a thought in my mind that I would build Austin’s largest digital billboard fleet, but what’s wonderful about our country is with a bit of grit, you can turn the unlikely into the future. Our unlikely and hungry team once looking from the outside in has been called the future of outdoor.</p>
                <p>When I was a Cavalry Scout, our main battle vehicle was called a Bradley Fighting Vehicle. For lack of a better description, it is a “baby tank,” light and nimble, armored to take a hit with tremendous firepower. If a Bradley is crewed by the right team, it can take down an entire platoon of tanks and completely change the battlefield when it’s in play.</p>
                <p>I have been asked many times how I came up with the answer to outdoor advertising, and I am reminded of Isaac Newton when he said “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” The foundation that I stand on is made of my team, giants in their positions. Without them, I would still be spinning my wheels in the startup traps.</p>
                <p>The very first giant I brought to the team was Steve Meyer, CTO of ABRAXAS. Steve has more than 30 years’ experience developing emerging technologies, has founded multiple startups and is a legendary mentor in <a href="https://www.techstars.com/">TechStars</a>. Steve is the engine of this vehicle, and without this man, I would be trying to push a tin car without power.</p>
                <p>Now that we had an engine, we had a potential to waste our ammo without proper spotting. So, we named the best spotter in the Austin startup world our CMO: Kristine Bryant, MBA. With her 10 years of marketing and business experience for multiple companies, we were able to put rounds on target and gain customers before we even had a beta to test. This is a dream for a commander of a Bradley fighting vehicle.</p>
                <p>In every Bradley crew, you need someone in the back hatch that loads ammo, fixes what breaks and keeps the vehicle in operation. To meet this need, we brought on Joshua Lawton as the COO of ABRAXAS Technology. He led a national pilot for a Presidential Major Initiative as a senior government official, was a Senior Consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton and received a Wells Fargo 2016 Clean Technology Award for developing an innovative and green product line. With Josh, we will be able to adjust fire quickly and resolve any issues.</p>
                <p>With this established team, we are taking on the objective of validating physical spaces such as billboards, events, retail and even smart cities. Today we have closed $75,000 in funding in just two weeks and are on target to hit 240 pre-orders of the ABRAXAS Scout by launch time. Our clients will finally be able to validate their marketing budget in the physical world and invest their marketing dollars more effectively.</p>
