Our technology allows advertisers to measure how many people viewed their advertisement and when, by passively collecting and aggregating each digital signature that passes within its vicinity. For the first time, we can measure the return on investment of outdoor advertisements.  I was recently described by <a href=\"http://www.nibletz.com/events/austin-startup-week/bunker-labs-Abraxas\">Nibletz</a> as “not your typical adman,” and that is an accurate depiction. When I left the Army, there was not a thought in my mind that I would build Austin’s largest digital billboard fleet, but what’s wonderful about our country is with a bit of grit, you can turn the unlikely into the future. Our unlikely and hungry team once looking from the outside in has been called the future of outdoor.  When I was a Cavalry Scout, our main battle vehicle was called a Bradley Fighting Vehicle. For lack of a better description, it is a “baby tank,” light and nimble, armored to take a hit with tremendous firepower. If a Bradley is crewed by the right team, it can take down an entire platoon of tanks and completely change the battlefield when it’s in play.  I have been asked many times how I came up with the answer to outdoor advertising, and I am reminded of Isaac Newton when he said \"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\" The foundation that I stand on is made of my team, giants in their positions. Without them, I would still be spinning my wheels in the startup traps.  The very first giant I brought to the team was Steve Meyer, CTO of ABRAXAS. Steve has more than 30 years’ experience developing emerging technologies, has founded multiple startups and is a legendary mentor in <a href=\"https://www.techstars.com/\">TechStars</a>. Steve is the engine of this vehicle, and without this man, I would be trying to push a tin car without power.  Now that we had an engine, we had a potential to waste our ammo without proper spotting. So, we named the best spotter in the Austin startup world our CMO: Kristine Bryant, MBA. With her 10 years of marketing and business experience for multiple companies, we were able to put rounds on target and gain customers before we even had a beta to test. This is a dream for a commander of a Bradley fighting vehicle.  In every Bradley crew, you need someone in the back hatch that loads ammo, fixes what breaks and keeps the vehicle in operation. To meet this need, we brought on Joshua Lawton as the COO of ABRAXAS Technology. He led a national pilot for a Presidential Major Initiative as a senior government official, was a Senior Consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton and received a Wells Fargo 2016 Clean Technology Award for developing an innovative and green product line. With Josh, we will be able to adjust fire quickly and resolve any issues.  With this established team, we are taking on the objective of validating physical spaces such as billboards, events, retail and even smart cities. Today we have closed $75,000 in funding in just two weeks and are on target to hit 240 pre-orders of the ABRAXAS Scout by launch time. Our clients will finally be able to validate their marketing budget in the physical world and invest their marketing dollars more effectively.  &nbsp;  Follow us on Twitter <a class=\"DashboardProfileCard-screennameLink u-linkComplex u-linkClean js-nav\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Abraxas_Tech\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"username u-dir\" dir=\"ltr\">@<b class=\"u-linkComplex-target\">Abraxas_Tech</b></span></a>",

                "contentEncoded": "The top trends in out of home advertising are in and while some of the findings are surprising there are some findings which confirm the visceral feelings that many of us have in the industry. One of the trends that excites us at Abraxas Technology is the growth of Digital Out of Home (OOH) media.  Digital Out of Home (OOH) marketing is going to account for 39% of total revenue of all out of home marketing by 2019. It is not hard to imagine how Digital OOH is going to impact the industry. There have been a lot of thoughts on this, but allow us to add to the plethora of conjecture. It was not too long ago that digital billboards and signage accounted for around 1% of the entire OOH market. Today that figure stands at 5% and it is unlikely that the industry is not going to continue to add and replace analog billboards with digital ones.  Therefore, one of the major trends that we believe is going to be seen moving forward is  <img class=\" wp-image-305 alignright\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ABRAXAS-Infographic-300x251.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"407\" height=\"341\" />pricing models that are reflective of those that we find in online advertising. One such pricing model can be based on timing, however that model will only be expanded on with third party data that is being collected, aggregated, and disseminated. But, imagine a world where digital billboards and signage show different advertisements that are based on who is going to see them in the next minute versus what demographic normally drives during a certain time. Abraxas Technology makes this not just conjecture, but a reality. By using our solution, digital OOH owners can use a pricing model that is more inclusive but does not reduce total revenue or value of the billboards and signage, while advertisers can more effectively use their ad spends and thereby spend less per campaign while having a greater ROI on customer conversions.  &nbsp;  If this future interests you, feel free to email me at JLawton@abraxastechnology.com.  &nbsp;  <em>Joshua Lawton is the COO and Co-Founder of Abraxas Technology. </em>  Follow us on Twitter <a class=\"DashboardProfileCard-screennameLink u-linkComplex u-linkClean js-nav\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Abraxas_Tech\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"username u-dir\" dir=\"ltr\">@<b class=\"u-linkComplex-target\">Abraxas_Tech</b></span></a>  Source: https://carto.com/blog/biggest-data-trends-outdoor-advertising-2017",

Believe me, when I first started digging into the numbers and reports, I was shocked. I’ve come of age and took my first knocks in business during a time in which ALL of traditional media was dying. Or so that’s what I was being lead to believe. Banner ads, click throughs, SEO, you name it, that was the new tried and true method upon which you could base your whole media strategy on. Sure people were still advertising in newspapers and in magazines, but the question that rang out like a chorus from around the business world was “Why?”. As Adwords and then Facebook ads grew in both impact and market value, a sector of the traditional media was forgotten by many of the enterprising business men and women. Yet, like the Little Engine That Could, this traditional media platform has steadily grown in both impact and in market value.  Right about now, you are probably wondering what is this long forgotten traditional media platform that has steadily grown in both impact and in value? It’s Out of Home media. Don’t worry, if you’re unfamiliar with what Out of Home media is. I guarantee you that you’ve seen this advertisement in action on the side of the road , at bus stops, and on the tops of taxis: billboards and signage.  <img class=\" wp-image-314 aligncenter\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/billboard-1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"369\" height=\"208\" />  According to Nielsen, OOH is the media that drives the most activity online. Those billboards that you see on the side of the roads that tell you “Does Billboard Advertising Work? It Just Did!” are more correct than you ever believed.  &nbsp; <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“OOH delivered more online activity per ad dollar spent compared with any other media.”</em></h2> &nbsp;  Allow me to put this in perspective for all of us digital natives who need a comparison that we can understand.  &nbsp; <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>“Nearly 40% of consumers visited a Facebook page or posted a message on Facebook after seeing an OOH ad.”</strong></em></h2> <strong> </strong>  By the way, that 40% exceeds the consumer conversion rate for every single type of digital advertisement.  In Austin, depending on the date and location, a 4 week billboard advertising campaign can cost $5,600 and this includes the printing of the ad that is going to be put up on the billboard!  So what’s holding many businesses from advertising on billboards? To put it plainly, it is a lack of success metrics that are easy for them to digest and which do not require a major study by Nielsen. That’s why we founded Abraxas Technology. That’s why we invented our patent pending solution that knows if an individual passed a billboard or any other type of physical signage and showed up in store or purchased from the advertiser online. By empowering businesses both large and small we are creating an inclusive environment by which they can participate and measure the success of their advertising campaigns on the best conversion media marketplace available today; Out of Home.

That’s where you come in. You love design. You love representing information in a way that is palatable, enjoyable, and easily understandable. You can code and while some people outside of software development would say that you are a developer, you consider yourself to be first and foremost a designer.  Lastly, you love a challenge and are looking for that opportunity to put your mark on a product by taking what backend developers have done and building the front end. You have a portfolio of previous sites and products that you have either contributed to or built yourself.  If all of this applies to you, you might just be exactly the type of person we are looking for.

                "contentEncoded": "If I were to ask you what is a cheaper advertising medium than Facebook, you might say Adwords. Maybe you’d say Twitter. But I guarantee you, that the vast majority of everybody reading this article would not say Out of Home, IE Billboards.  Now I don’t expect you to believe me. Abraxas Technology is in the business of making billboards and digital signage more valuable for both business and OOH owners. However, that’s why I source all my material.  <img class=\"size-medium wp-image-327 alignleft\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-16-at-4.03.04-PM-300x112.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"112\" />  According to Geopath, a non-profit leader in the Out of Home market the average cost for a 4 week advertisement on a traditional billboard is $3,000 over 4 weeks. This leads to an average of 20,000,000 impressions over the 4 week advertisement.  &nbsp;  While it is difficult to nail down a specific average cost per impression for a Facebook ad, on average it costs about $5 per 1,000 impressions. This means that in order to hit the 5,000,000 impressions that you hit per week with Out of Home advertising in Atlanta, you would cough up $25,000 and that’s just to hit the number of impressions that you would with a billboard in Atlanta in a week!  &nbsp;  <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-333\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-16-at-3.25.35-PM-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1152\" height=\"176\" /> <h2></h2> <h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Even if you choose billboards in less trafficked Atlanta areas, like the one below that has 1,391,128 weekly impressions, it is still cheaper per impression on a billboard than it is on a Facebook ad!</h3> &nbsp;  <img class=\"size-full wp-image-334 aligncenter\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-16-at-4.38.58-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"552\" height=\"325\" />  Now, I can hear the nay-sayers, \"Sure billboards are cheaper per impression, because they're billboards. Who actually pays attention to them?\" But if you've been reading our blog or paying attention to reports coming out of the advertising industry, you would know that this is not the case at all. But, don't rely on this article, head on over <a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/you-wont-believe-which-advertisements-drive-the-most-online-activity\">You Wouldn't Believe Which Advertisements Drive the Most Online Activity</a> and find out why billboards do matter.  &nbsp;  If you're interested in what Abraxas Technology can do for you, send me an e-mail at <a href=\"mailto:JLawton@abraxastechnology.com\">JLawton@abraxastechnology.com</a>.  <em>Joshua Lawton is the COO and Co-Founder of Abraxas Technology.</em>  Follow us on Twitter <a class=\"DashboardProfileCard-screennameLink u-linkComplex u-linkClean js-nav\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Abraxas_Tech\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"username u-dir\" dir=\"ltr\">@<b class=\"u-linkComplex-target\">Abraxas_Tech</b></span></a>  Sources:  https://fitsmallbusiness.com/how-much-does-billboard-advertising-cost  https://blog.bufferapp.com/facebook-advertising-cost  https://www.facebook.com/business/help/753932008002620  &nbsp;",

                "contentEncoded": "The problem with crashes or major pull backs is that you normally do not foresee them or prepare for them adequately. Even after the event occurs, it’s only historical hindsight that puts them into perspective. Now unlike many other articles you might read, even some written by me, I’m not talking about cryptocurrencies. I am talking about marketing budgets. For the past three years marketing budgets as a proportion of company revenues have been increasing. Sometimes they increased slightly, other times they increased heavily. However, the one fact remained the same, they increased. <h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>“Only 14% of respondents surveyed in last year’s CMO Spend survey anticipated a cut in 2017.”</em></strong></h3> &nbsp;  From the battles of Waterloo, to San Jacinto, to Vicksburg, to Normandy, the losers did not realize that their high water mark had come and passed and while comparing the French Empire, Empire of Mexico, Confederate States of America, and Third Reich to what happened and is happening to marketing budgets is an egregious use of an analogy, for this veteran and one time historian, it is a good visual, because 2017 was a terrible year for marketing budgets.  <img class=\"wp-image-346 aligncenter\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-17-at-2.24.52-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"439\" />  &nbsp;  Sure, I know what you’re thinking, a 7% fall in marketing budgets does not sound like a catastrophic fall. However, when you take into account that US corporate profits increased by 8% from October 2016 to October 2017, what you are really seeing is a sizable decrease in marketing budgets.  &nbsp;  <img class=\"wp-image-347 aligncenter\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-17-at-2.44.30-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"735\" height=\"317\" />  This decrease in marketing budgets is especially acute for marketing technology companies. Depending on the size and stage of the company, a shrinking market size is not just detrimental to their business models, but can be fatal. While this snowball did not completely roll down the hill to all marketing technology companies in 2017, the significant pullback in Martech spending will impact all companies in 2018.  Gartner’s “CMO Spend Survey 2017-2018”. <h3></h3> <h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>“Martech spending has fallen by 15%.”</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong></h3> &nbsp;  Furthermore, the inability of both marketing technology companies and marketers to utilize advanced Reach-Cost-Quality (RCQ) models has negatively impacted media investment. Thereby resulting in CMO’s increasing spends on agencies while reducing their own spends on internal labor. Even after the reduction in internal labor spends, CMO’s are still deploying slightly over half of their budgets on talent resources.  Now all is not doom and gloom for those of us in the marketing sector. CMOs and marketers have received a mandate to “show their financial management credentials, proving they can assume accountability for business performance”. Companies, like Abraxas Technology, who rely on data, to provide marketing and advertising spend ROI, are positioned to reap the rewards of this re-focusing of priorities. As marketing budgets shrink, it will become more important to provide models and reports that rely heavily on data that is relatable to business priorities. No longer is it acceptable for marketers to respond with the age old adage  &nbsp; <h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>“Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is, I don't know which half.”</em></strong></h3> &nbsp;  If you’re tired of hearing a version of this response from your marketing, agency, or media buying team contact us over at Abraxas Technology to learn how we can help.  &nbsp;  <em>Joshua Lawton is the COO and Co-Founder of Abraxas Technology.</em>  Follow us on Twitter <a class=\"DashboardProfileCard-screennameLink u-linkComplex u-linkClean js-nav\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Abraxas_Tech\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"username u-dir\" dir=\"ltr\">@<b class=\"u-linkComplex-target\">Abraxas_Tech</b></span></a>  Sources Quoted:  https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/corporate-profits  Gartner: \"CMO SPEND SURVEY 2017-2018: BUDGETS RECEDE AMID DEMAND FOR RESULTS\"  &nbsp;  &nbsp;",

Abraxas Technology bridges this divide for both markets with our patent pending product that knows if an individual passed by a piece of physical media, how many times they passed, how long they were in front of it, and then if they ended up going to the advertiser's store or to their website.

Too often, this is the mantra for how companies assign their marketing and advertising budget. When Justin was selling digital billboards here in the Austin area he had a client call 2 weeks before SXSW begging for advertisement because they realized their competitor was going to be advertising.  </span>  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don’t know this already, SXSW is a marketing force for companies that want to show they have arrived as the “event of the year.” Massive event marketing spends are allocated for this event but during the last SXSW only a few of the major venues were packed while the rest of the venues were giving away free beer just to fill their space to justify their ROI and the spends are not small. According to Greyhill Advisors, “In 2016 the value of SXSW print, broadcast and online publications coverage totaled $223 million. The increase in SXSW’s media valuation reflects a more comprehensive assessment of international media coverage.” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>  &nbsp; <h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><i>“31% of marketers believe that events are the single-most effective marketing channel over digital advertising, email marketing and content marketing.”</i></strong></h3> &nbsp;  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Granted, the SXSW example is an extreme case of event and marketing spending but this outlines the issue of event marketing as a line item in your budget. If you do not know your ROI for each dollar spent, than you are unable to mitigate ineffectual uses of marketing dollars. But how do you know how to accurately calculate an event’s strategic ROI? According to The Balance, an event’s strategic ROI can be calculated by two main methods:</span> <ol>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The organization may view ROI by aggregating all costs and comparing this to a value that is estimated by the organization. And then determines the financial benefits of the event. an organizational level and at a participant level. </span></li>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ROI at the participant level may be measured at the individual level and estimates the value on a per participant basis.”</span></li> </ol> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As any marketer or event planner will tell you, figuring out an event’s ROI today is as much about how the business owner or client feels the event went as it is through the magic of financial calculations. Pack the house? That’s great! But what if none of these people ever end up coming to your store to buy your product? Two musicians jammed out? That’s fabulous! But what if the one musician that you payed more money for decreased the amount of time people stayed at your event? In almost every other aspect of business, data drives business decisions. However, all too often when it comes to events, we aren’t making decisions based on data because we do not want to, but rather because there is a significant lack of data with which to make those decisions.</span>  <a href=\"https://www.sxsw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-SXSW-Economic-Impact-Analysis.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></a> <h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b><i>“44% of event marketers would like new event technology that provides analytics (booth visits, length of stay, etc.) in order to improve the exhibitor and attendee experience.” </i></b></h3> <a href=\"https://www.sxsw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-SXSW-Economic-Impact-Analysis.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></a>  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And yet even with the lack of data , in 2017 “...</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">63% of marketers plan on investing more in live events in the future both in budget and number of events.” and “28% of companies allocate over 20% of their marketing budget to organizing events.” All of this led to companies spending $26.1B on live events in 2017. </span>  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Event marketers aren't the only ones experiencing a lack of data, from billboards to ads on buses, calculating the ROI on marketing spends in the physical world lacks data. At Abraxas Technology, we believe that no amount of creative can refute the data. By using our patent pending product at an event, event managers can provide their clients with specific ROI metrics related to the event, and clients and business owners can know and show their investors and boards how many event attendees converted into customers. </span>  &nbsp;  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to learn how Abraxas Technology can help you figure out your event’s ROI.

(If you don’t know why this information is counterfactual head on over to this article that I previously wrote: “</span><a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/you-wont-believe-which-advertisements-drive-the-most-online-activity\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You Won't Believe Which Advertisements Drive the Most Online Activity</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”.)</span>  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond just understanding the data, what OOH owners and believers need is the ability to connect and explain their medium’s value to marketers, advertisers, and most importantly small business owners who are all dogmatic believers in the strength of online marketing. The OOH market needs to be able to break through the general malaise with which the OOH space is viewed because unlike the online space, the Out of Home market on the whole lacks the data that marketers, advertisers, and small business owners believe is essential to their campaigns. </span>  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond the product that we at <a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/\">Abraxas Technology</a> provide to fix this lack of OOH data, there are several key points that can refute the strongest misheld belief and convert non-believers into believers:</span>  &nbsp; <h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b><i>Business is global and marketing needs to reach that audience.</i></b></h3> &nbsp;  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is an often misheld opinion by many within the marketing space. Sure some businesses have a global footprint and some businesses want to have a global footprint. However the vast majority of U.S. businesses do not have a global footprint, much less a national one. To be frank, utilizing a medium that has a higher cost and produces less online activity makes little sense for campaigns that have a budget (By the way I’m referring specifically to Facebook ads, not billboards. Read this article if you don’t believe me “</span><a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/you-wont-believe-which-advertising-medium-is-cheaper-per-impression-than-facebook-ads\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You Wont Believe Which Advertising Medium is Cheaper Per Impression Than Facebook Ads.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”). So what should you point to in order to counter this argument? Focus on the reality of the US business sector:</span> <ol>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Small Business Administration, small businesses make up 99.7% of U.S. employer firms and 46% of private-sector output. </span></li>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While 51% of Americans prefer to shop online, 74% of small business websites do not have ecommerce. </span></li>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6 out of 10 small business owners cannot track their social media marketing ROI.</span></li>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">72% of individuals who did a local search visited a store within 5 miles.</span></li>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">62% of small business owners say Facebook ads miss their targets.</span></li> </ol> Beyond these bullet points, it is important to remember that most business is transacted locally. 64% of consumers' budgets are still spent in store versus 36% being spent online. The range that people are willing to drive to buy non-luxury cars, a big ticket item, on average is less than 30 miles, and the range becomes even worse for non-big ticket items.  <img class=\"wp-image-388 aligncenter\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-25-at-10.09.04-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"608\" height=\"366\" />  The range limitations are further compounded by the total market share of ecommerce within the United States. While ecommerce has continued to take up more of the total retail dollars spent, it still accounts for only 9%. This means that even though we viscerally feel like most of our retail transaction occur online, they in fact do not, and therefore are constrained by the time that people are willing to travel.  <img class=\" wp-image-389 aligncenter\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-25-at-10.05.06-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"767\" height=\"297\" />  &nbsp;  None of this is to say that online retail transactions are unimportant. Rather it helps focus the attention on where and how consumers are spending their money. Yet, creating believers out of disbelievers is hard. If you are lacking the data that these media buyers and small business owners are craving, you will not be able to sell more ads or increase the value of your boards.  &nbsp;  If you're interested in how Abraxas Technology can help you convert these non-believers don't hesitate to send me an e-mail at <a href=\"mailto:JLawton@abraxastechnology.com\">JLawton@abraxastechnology.com</a>.  &nbsp;  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joshua Lawton is the COO and Co-Founder of Abraxas Technology</span>  <em>Follow us on Twitter <a class=\"DashboardProfileCard-screennameLink u-linkComplex u-linkClean js-nav\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Abraxas_Tech\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"username u-dir\" dir=\"ltr\">@<b class=\"u-linkComplex-target\">Abraxas_Tech</b></span></a></em>  &nbsp;  Sources Quoted:  <a href=\"https://smallbiztrends.com/2016/06/small-business-ecommerce-trends.html\">https://smallbiztrends.com/2016/06/small-business-ecommerce-trends.html</a>  <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\">https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics</a>  <a href=\"https://smallbiztrends.com/2017/01/do-facebook-ads-work.html\">https://smallbiztrends.com/2017/01/do-facebook-ads-work.html</a>  <a href=\"http://ipage.com/blog/27-small-business-statistics/\">http://ipage.com/blog/27-small-business-statistics/</a>  <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/FAQ_Sept_2012.pdf\">https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/FAQ_Sept_2012.pdf</a>  <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonnazar/2013/09/09/16-surprising-statistics-about-small-businesses/#1b6ab42d5ec8\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonnazar/2013/09/09/16-surprising-statistics-about-small-businesses/#1b6ab42d5ec8</a>  <a href=\"http://www.marketingprofs.com/charts/2016/31051/how-far-consumers-travel-to-make-everyday-purchases\">http://www.marketingprofs.com/charts/2016/31051/how-far-consumers-travel-to-make-everyday-purchases</a>  <a href=\"https://www.am-online.com/news/market-insight/2016/05/24/how-far-will-buyers-travel-for-their-dream-car--carwow-insight\">https://www.am-online.com/news/market-insight/2016/05/24/how-far-will-buyers-travel-for-their-dream-car--carwow-insight</a>  <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ECOMPCTSA\">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ECOMPCTSA</a>  &nbsp;",

From cars to trucks, shoppers would love to be able to customize their options and hit a buy now button. But there’s one catch. While shoppers want to be able to buy their next vehicle online, a majority of shoppers wouldn’t buy their next automobile without test driving the model. In fact, shoppers love the test drive experience. What they hate is the buying experience. Who can blame them? There’re only so many free waters that a dealership can give you while your new car is being detailed while you wait.  <a href=\"http://www.v12data.com/blog/25-amazing-statistics-on-how-consumers-shop-for-cars/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"wp-image-394 aligncenter\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-28-at-7.52.47-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"611\" height=\"360\" /></a>  Even with online searches and social media, shoppers are still more likely to directly search for dealerships of which they are aware. Adding to this need by dealership to be top of mind for shoppers is the fact that 61% of new car buyers’ first contact with a dealer is still done by walking into the dealership.  <a href=\"http://www.v12data.com/blog/25-amazing-statistics-on-how-consumers-shop-for-cars/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"wp-image-395 aligncenter\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-28-at-8.00.16-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"419\" /></a>  This means that with less and less Americans watching local commercial television and with more sophisticated ad blocking done by consumers online, dealerships need to get their name and brand out in front of consumers in order to drive them to their lots. While, digital marketing is an important part of the marketing mix for dealers, when only 22% of shoppers use social media to search for their next vehicle, and out of those 13% state that the information on social media influenced their purchase decision, it is hard to see a significant return on investment on a heavily weighted digital marketing strategy. In fact, if creating online traffic is the first step to get a shopper to come to the dealership, Nielsen has shown that out of home advertising is the most effective means of creating online activity across all mediums. If you think your Facebook ad does a better job of getting people to your site, the data says otherwise. Suddenly, U.S. dealerships spending $1.3B on digital campaigns does not seem like the wisest use of money.  But, for all of us in the Out of Home market, don’t fret. As late as 2015, dealerships were still spending over $2B on newspaper ads! So, why aren’t dealerships spending as much on Out of Home media as they should be? Simply put, it’s the age-old story of a lack of data.  <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/318246/automotive-dealers-services-ad-spend-medium/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"wp-image-396 alignright\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-28-at-8.35.40-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"405\" height=\"319\" /></a>  It’s easy for them to see the conversions on their websites from their digital marketing. It’s hard for marketers and agencies schooled these days in the data science approach to marketing versus the Mad Men creative school of marketing to get past doing out of home advertising for any other reason than the reason why politicians do robo-calling when they know everybody hangs up the moment they realize it’s a robo-call: everybody else is doing it. Yet, this is not a strategy for success and knowing what we know about <a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/you-wont-believe-which-advertising-medium-is-cheaper-per-impression-than-facebook-ads\">cost per impressions </a>and <a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/you-wont-believe-which-advertisements-drive-the-most-online-activity\">driving online activity</a>, it is hard to understand how marketers can defend this marketing spend mix.

More importantly, there are some industries with whom OOH owners are more comfortable selling to, which usually means that less well understood industries go untouched. Healthcare is one such industry. Even though as a whole it is an industry not spend a large percentage of its advertising budgets on out of home media, it does share commonalities with retail stores across America: people have to physically come in to a brick and mortar location.  As the healthcare market becomes more competitive and the number of players shrinks, their average ad spends have continued to increase since 2013. This is all the more interesting since healthcare faces a unique challenge when advertising to consumers: regulatory hurdles imposed by the government. ­  &nbsp;  <a href=\"http://gaia.adage.com/images/bin/pdf/KantarHCwhitepaper_complete.pdf\"><img class=\"wp-image-411 aligncenter\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-01-at-9.51.55-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"255\" height=\"310\" /></a>  However, this increase in ad spends has not been equally felt within the healthcare industry’s sub-categories. Primarily, growth has been seen in the hospital/medical and pharmaceutical sub-categories.  <a href=\"http://gaia.adage.com/images/bin/pdf/KantarHCwhitepaper_complete.pdf\"><img class=\"wp-image-412 aligncenter\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-01-at-10.05.06-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"358\" /></a>  Even with this growth in marketing spends, US hospitals on average spend less than 1% of their budgets on marketing. This translates to US healthcare networks’ marketing budgets ranging from $1.3M to $5.8M. Ascension, the United States’ largest not-for-profit hospital system with 140 hospitals and $21B in revenue during 2016, spends 75% of its advertising budget on traditional media channels to include OOH. However, while large healthcare networks provide opportunities for OOH owners, it is in fact private practices that spend a larger percentage of their budgets on marketing.  <a href=\"https://bakerlabs.co/much-medical-practice-spend-marketing/\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-413\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-01-at-10.32.27-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1746\" height=\"724\" /></a>More importantly, private practice clinicians have a hyper-local business model. This model lends itself well to OOH because patients are unwilling to travel great distances for regular care or even urgent care.  <a href=\"https://www.ofm.wa.gov/sites/default/files/public/legacy/researchbriefs/2013/brief070.pdf\"><img class=\"wp-image-414 aligncenter\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-01-at-10.37.32-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"565\" height=\"303\" /></a>  Therefore, how should OOH owners sell their boards to the healthcare industry: <ul>  	<li><strong>Focus on conversion metrics: </strong>Private practices are specially interested in what advertising mediums led customers into their practices. While patients on average report that a referral was one of the leading causes of their selection, the data is mixed at best. <a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/\">Abraxas Technology’s product</a> provides those direct conversion metrics, allowing OOH owners the ability to tell private practices (and other brick and mortar locations) the number of people who passed the board, the average frequency they passed the board, the average duration that they were in front of the board, and the percentage of people who went by the board and then showed up in the private practice.</li>  	<li><strong>Focus on high margin private practices: </strong>Even though 52% of all patient visits are made to primary care physicians, primary care margins are relatively restricted and competition is based more on convenience than on brand. However, this is not true across all practices. One type of private practice in particular lends itself well to OOH: cosmetic and plastic surgery practices. With year over year growth in the number of cosmetic and plastic surgery procedures, Americans spent in 2016 over $16B. The high cost to the consumer per procedure combined with the importance of the end result to the consumer means that cosmetic and plastic surgery practices are competing on reputation and branding. Both of which can be highly impacted by OOH media.</li> </ul> <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/plastic-surgery-growth-statistics-facts-2016-2017-5\"><img class=\"wp-image-415 aligncenter\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-01-at-10.55.09-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"539\" height=\"330\" /></a> <ul>  	<li><strong>Focus on dental practices: </strong>According to Dental Economics, the right percentage of gross revenue that dental practices should spend on their marketing is around 20%. The increasing average gross revenue combined with the increased amount collected belies a problem being experienced within the dentistry practices. From 2008 until 2009 the percent of revenue collected fell. Beyond identifying better account receivable solutions, one way that dental practices can mitigate this problem is by attracting higher margin clients with new services beyond traditional dentist procedures that needs to be marketed to consumers.</li> </ul> <a href=\"http://www.dentalproductsreport.com/dental/article/latest-revenue-data-dental-practices-across-nation?page=0,0\"><img class=\"wp-image-416 aligncenter\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-01-at-2.40.09-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"552\" height=\"343\" /></a>  If you’re interested in how Abraxas Technology can help you increase healthcare marketing spends with you, don’t hesitate to send me an e-mail at <a href=\"mailto:JLawton@abraxastechnology.com\">JLawton@abraxastechnology.com</a>.

It's hard to believe that it's only February 9th because we received the ask to get devices up to them on February 2nd, so that they could be set up today.  This isn't just a pat on the back for us type article, but rather it highlights one of the key parts of most companies' businesses that are the last to be put on a firm footing: supply chain. While most people view the supply chain as only something that companies that produce physical products must take into account, the supply chain is in fact integral to businesses that deliver software and consulting services, because regardless of the company the supply chain is the backbone of a company's ability to scale.  So what are some of the ways by which a business that supplies products and services to OOH providers can put their supply chain on a firm footing?  - Define the priority for your supply chain. (This is similar to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ONE-Thing-Surprisingly-Extraordinary-Results/dp/B00FPVS27W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1518208549&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=one+thing\">Peter Thiel’s “One Thing”</a> concept). Your supply chain is there to do one thing phenomenally well. That one thing follows the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle\">80/20 rule</a>.  - Create accountability. A supply chain that works requires accountability. From sourcing your product to outsourcing your labor, to your startup team, accountability to deliver an ethical and superior product is necessary.  - Your customer isn't only at the end of your supply chain. Contrary to what people are taught, your customer isn't only at the end of your supply chain. Your customers are at multiple points within your supply chain. Since customers equate to demand, and demand is<a href=\"http://cerasis.com/2015/05/06/lean-supply-chain/\"><img class=\" wp-image-423 alignright\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-09-at-2.18.13-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"264\" height=\"265\" /></a> directly correlated throughout the entirety of your supply chain, you need to understand how the demand flows through your supply chain and who your customers are throughout the supply chain.  - Always have the ability to meet a certain number of orders (or customer requests in SW) without needing to rely on an external source to deliver. Keep packaging on hand. Have your inventory strategically placed as you grow (when you are just beginning this means in your office) (in SW think of this as how you automate customer builds, stand up instances, etc).  - Lean doesn't necessarily mean less costly. There are three main factors to every supply chain: ability to produce the product, quality of product delivered, and ability to deliver the product (normally referred to as velocity, throughput, and variation).  - Lastly sometimes when you are unable to meet the customer's ask, do your best to deliver what your customer actually wants.  &nbsp;  Want to connect with us about how <a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/\">Abraxas Technology</a> can help you know who saw your boards and then came to your advertisers' stores?

As of 2017, there were only 7,000 digital billboards in the entire United States. While this significantly underrepresents the full digital signage market, it is instructive into where the out of home market is going, because year on year growth of digital billboards and signage in the US has been 10%. This growth in digital signage is because the out of home market is the one market that can’t be cord cut, whose ads can’t be skipped, and whose marketing can’t be ad blocked.  This growth in the digital signage market is not just due to it being the last medium that can not be avoided, it’s because serious marketers know that it is highly effective.  &nbsp; <h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>“…travelers who had passed the billboards could remember specific ads from those campaigns up to 89 percent of the time.”</em></strong></h3> <strong> </strong>  When you consider that digital signage’s cost per impression is less than 10% of most other advertising mediums, it is hard to understand why out of home marketing is normally the throw away portion of most marketing budgets. (well it’s not that hard to understand since the out of home market has been missing conversion data, IE did an individual see a board and turn up in the advertiser’s store or go online, which is why we created <a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/\">Abraxas Technology</a> to provide that data to OOH owners and advertisers.) Many marketers, whose clients are mainly composed of local businesses, discredit the cost per impression of the out of home market. Therefore, they are leading their clients towards online mediums to advertise, even though study after study has shown that consumers better remember out of home advertisement when compared to online ads.  &nbsp; <h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>“…71 percent said they felt advertising on digital billboards </strong><strong>stood out more than online ads...”</strong></h3> <strong> </strong>  One of the main reasons why out of home advertising is more effective than online mediums is that it is local, consumers are targeted in context, and most importantly the advertising does not interrupt their experience. These factors contribute to why exposure times to digital out of home media was forecasted to increase by 20 minutes per week in 2017 and why the growth in digital out of home advertising spends are going to significantly increase.  &nbsp; <h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>“Zenith forecasts that DOOH will grow faster globally than all other buying methods, and PricewaterhouseCoopers predicts that DOOH advertising revenues will overtake traditional media spend in 2020, growing at a rate of 15% a year for the next four years.”</strong></h3> <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/global-entertainment-media-outlook/segment-insights/assets/PDF/out-of-home-advertising-by-growth-and-scale.pdf\"><img class=\"wp-image-544 aligncenter\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-16-at-2.40.23-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"784\" height=\"376\" /></a>  This growth in DOOH is directly correlated to the rise of programmatic buying of OOH media. The ability of companies like <a href=\"https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/\">DoubleClick</a> to tie into companies like us at <a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/\">Abraxas Technology</a>, allows for the combination of their knowledge of your online profile with our knowledge of what you do in the real world to give for the first time a full picture of the customer. This powerful and giant leap forward in data is why more and more marketers and advertisers are turning to the OOH market.  &nbsp;  Want to connect with us about how <a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/\">Abraxas Technology</a> can help you know who saw your boards and then came to your advertisers’ stores?

All I know is how to sit down and order a meal”</strong></h3> &nbsp;  If you feel like Paulie from <em>Goodfella</em>s when selling into the restaurant industry, don’t worry, you’re not alone. While national food chains spend big on OOH media, OOH owners are missing significant restaurant opportunities in their own backyards, because 7 in 10 restaurants are single unit operations. These owners don’t own multiple stores, so they are often overlooked by OOH owners while at the same time single unit operations do not believe that they have the budget to do an effective OOH campaign.  [embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxGjPCOpbv0[/embed]  &nbsp;  However, OOH owners should not overlook single unit operations, much less the restaurant industry as a whole, as a client source. It’s easy to forget that Americans spent $720 billion at restaurants in 2016. Considering, Americans’ total food budget, the amount spent at restaurants comes out to nearly half of every food dollar an American spends. While not equally distributed across all regions, on average restaurants in the United States bring in $992,000 in revenue yearly.  Restaurants are not foreigners to marketing their restaurants. Currently, 40% of their marketing budget goes to digital marketing. While this presents a hurdle to OOH owners for capturing a greater share of a restaurant’s marketing mix, it is important to note that restaurants are either increasing or maintaining their marketing budgets by 84%. Depending on the restaurant’s goals for their business, their marketing budget roughly breaks down into the following percentages below.  <a href=\"http://www.fliphound.com/files/billboard-out-of-home-advertising-resources/arbitron-out-of-home-advertising-study.pdf#page=10\"><img class=\"wp-image-567 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-01-at-10.32.27-AM-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1746\" height=\"724\" /></a>  Even though this marketing budget may not be enough in many regions of the United States to do long term OOH marketing, it is enough to do effective OOH marketing, because of the combination of how restaurant customers interact with OOH media and the seasonality of the restaurant industry. Seasonality of restaurants varies based on location and main business drivers. For instance, New York City sees a reduction in restaurant traffic during the summer because New Yorkers spend an increased amount of time outside of the city, while in Williamsburg, Virginia increased traffic is seen during the summer season due to an influx of consumers due to the tourist season. This seasonality combined with the fact that 26% of people have immediately visited a restaurant specifically because they saw a billboard or other out-of-home advertisement is a powerful way to shape an OOH campaign around a restaurant’s budget to create the highest return on investment for the restaurant.  &nbsp; <h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>“Engagement with billboards is considerably high. Over 8 in 10 billboard viewers make a point to look at the advertising message at least some of the time; nearly half look at the billboard ad each time or almost each time they noticed one.”</strong></h3> <a href=\"http://www.fliphound.com/files/billboard-out-of-home-advertising-resources/arbitron-out-of-home-advertising-study.pdf#page=10\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-569 size-full\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-22-at-11.44.42-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1274\" height=\"358\" /></a>  Besides being able to pat ourselves on the back for OOH media being an effective advertising medium, the serious question that needs to be answered is “What key points do I want to bring up when selling to a restaurant owner or manager?” <ol>  	<li>40% of adults who viewed OOH media in the past month visited the restaurant that was advertised.</li>  	<li>Directional billboard advertisements have a serious impact on sales. In one study, a Wendy's directional billboard advertisements increased sales by 32% within the first week of being posted.</li>  	<li>8 in 10 restaurant owners started out at entry level positions.</li>  	<li>52% of polled Americans stated that it was easier to do their taxes than figuring out how to eat healthy.</li>  	<li>Millennials eat out on average 3.4 times a week. Baby Boomers eat out 2.8 times a week.</li>  	<li>Adding out of home billboard advertising into the ad campaign on average increases the reach of TV by 18%, Radio by 45%, Mobile by 316%, and Social Media by 212%.</li> </ol> At the end of the day, what is going to seriously add to a restaurant’s OOH spend and convince other restaurant owners if they want to have a campaign with you, is your ability to prove to them that advertising on your billboards leads to conversions of customers into their restaurants.

I go because it is the best place to see the future, today</em>.\" —Elliot Tomaeno, founder and CEO of Astrsk PR  <img class=\"size-full wp-image-599 alignright\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Bluebonnets.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"180\" />For an Austinite, there are two tell-tale signs of springtime. First, we see the blooming bluebonnets. Texas’s <a href=\"https://www.statesman.com/news/local/photos-the-bluebonnet-became-texas-state-flower-117-years-ago-today/YUfKFEjftH66BDj3omv0iL/\">iconic state flower</a> has already transformed our hills, highways, parks, and campuses into a <a href=\"https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/texas/article/Texas-bluebonnet-season-expert-photography-tips-12729451.php\">vibrant blue hue</a>.  As we drink in this natural beauty, our busy lives are to become busier as <a href=\"http://sxsw.com/\">South by Southwest (SXSW)</a> arrives in town.  SXSW is Austin’s biggest event of the year, drawing tens of thousands of people across the United States and from all over the world. Much more than a music and film festival, SXSW is the perfect launchpad for new entrepreneurs to introduce themselves to the world and build their brand. In this bubbling cauldron of innovation and energy, the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/08/why-entrepreneurs-say-sxsw-is-still-worth-the-crowds-and-traffic.html\">right meeting of the minds</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/matt_ridley_when_ideas_have_sex\">cross-pollination of ideas</a> may very well lead to the “next big thing.”  Understandably, companies unleash their marketing and advertising campaigns in full-force for the “event of the year.” <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2017/09/27/austins-tourismcash-cow-sxsw-economic-impact-grows.html\">According</a> to the <em>Austin Business Journal</em>, SXSW 2017 generated approximately $349 million (up 7 percent from 2016) for the local Austin economy, the economic equivalent of hosting the Super Bowl. Furthermore, consulting firm Greyhill Advisors’ comprehensive <a href=\"https://www.sxsw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2017-SXSW-Economic-Impact-Press-Release.pdf\">economic analysis</a> reveal that: <blockquote>The value of SXSW print, broadcast and online publications coverage in 2017 totaled <strong>$572.3 million</strong>. The considerable increase in SXSW’s media valuation compared to previous years reflects a more accurate snapshot of media publications and the resulting audience exposure to SXSW coverage.</blockquote> The growing economic impact and business potential of large-scale events such as SXSW are not lost on marketers. According to an eye-opening <a href=\"https://blog.bizzabo.com/event-marketing-statistics\">report</a> from event management company Bizzabo, 31% of mid-level and senior level marketers believe that “events are the single-most effective marketing channel over digital advertising, email marketing and content marketing.” Other trends in this report reveal that: <ul>  	<li>The majority (80%) of marketers believe live events are critical to their company’s success. (Bizzabo, 2017)</li>  	<li>An overwhelming majority of C-Suite executives (87%) believe in the power of live events and plan on investing in them more in the future. (<a href=\"https://blog.bizzabo.com/event-marketing-2018-benchmarks-and-trends\">Bizzabo</a>, 2017)</li>  	<li>The majority of overperforming businesses (91%) place a greater emphasis on live events as a marketing channel than underperforming businesses or businesses that are performing as expected. They also plan on growing their event marketing budgets by more than the rest ($4,500 more). (Bizzabo, 2017)</li>  	<li>75% of marketers believe that in the upcoming years, live events will become increasingly important to their organization’s success. (Bizzabo, 2017)</li> </ul> All this being said, based on past analysis and future forecasts, SXSW is a literal goldmine for out-of-home advertisers. That is, if they know where and how to dig and what tools to use. Despite the immense <a href=\"https://www.sxsw.com/marketing/\">marketing opportunities available at SXSW</a> and elsewhere, all of that potential can be lost if a business does not know how to measure the ROI from their marketing and event spending.  While networking and the experience itself certainly matter from events such SXSW, what if the prospects and contacts you make at the event never visit your store, call your number, or follow through? With so many people going to SXSW, it is very easy to get lost in the crowd. Furthermore, there are inherent limitations in acquiring data from out-of-home (OOH) advertisements (the problem that <a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/\">Abraxas Technology</a> was founded to fix) such as subway ads and traditional billboards compared to online advertising such as Google AdWords which can measure audience demographics, click-through rates, and spending ROI.  Here at Abraxas Technology, as Austinites who revel in creativity and cutting-edge technology, we believe it is possible to bring together the world of OOH advertising with the insights of big data and the empowerment of the digital age. Most importantly for OOH owners, the increasing penetration of digital media with the onset of augmented reality will force traditional OOH owners to collect and provide relevant data to marketers and advertisers.  &nbsp;  Reach out to us today if you want to begin providing relevant data to marketers and advertisers.

While any search for a bomber is akin to a needle in the haystack, we believe that our technology can assist law enforcement with collecting information that can be used to identify the perpetrator or perpetrators of these heinous acts of terrorism against Austinites. With your help we can deploy our devices around Austin. Even though we pray that another attack will not occur, if it does, and if one of our devices is in the vicinity, we will be able to provide information for law enforcement to use to clear away some of the hay and make the needle easier to find.  [embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0xJn2Weanw[/embed]  We are deploying our devices and services for free until the bomber is caught. All we need is a regular power outlet that we can connect our device into. The device is unobtrusive and is the size of an iPhone. If you would like for us to put a device in your home or in your retail location, please contact us. You can send us a tweet at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Abraxas_Tech\">Abraxas_Tech</a> or you can email Justin and I at our emails below.  We know that there are no silver bullets, but we can’t stand idly by and do nothing while our community is under attack.  *March 21, 2018 Note: With the danger having passed and the bomber having killed himself, all of Austin can breathe a sigh of relief. We will be reaching out to everyone who had a device deployed in their homes and businesses to thank them, and also contacting everyone who asked us for a device that we did not yet get a device to.  <a href=\"mailto:JLawton@abraxastechnology.com\">JLawton@abraxastechnology.com</a>  <a href=\"mailto:J.Gilfus@abraxastechnology.com\">J.Gilfus@abraxastechnology.com</a>  Follow us on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Abraxas_Tech\">Abraxas_Tech</a>",

As a member of OAAA’s Innovations Committee and as the COO and Co-Founder of <a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/\">Abraxas Technology</a>, I am often asked by those in the OOH industry about which technology is best for them to use to increase sales and show a return on investment for advertisers. You might find this hard to believe, but I do not always recommend our own technology. I know that we are the best at what we do (being able to passively collect data to show conversions, IE if somebody saw a billboard and then appeared in the store or online), however depending on the use case there are other options available.  That said, it can be difficult for OOH owners and advertisers to not only understand the different options, but also have the data to back why or why not they should use one technology over another. To that end, below is an explanation of the different technologies available and what they can optimally do and what they cannot optimally do.  <strong>Camera technology:</strong> Camera technology is a system to count the number of impressions. While some camera technology companies only claim to be able to count the number of impressions, others claim to be able to provide you with the ability to know if an impression actually interacted/looked at your advertisement and how they felt. While the ability to track eye movement with heat maps is well established, there are some great studies on the problems that are inherent in tracking human emotions. I do not want to inundate you with tons of studies, so I'll link you to one of the major reputable studies done by the National Institutes of Health. In short, the summary of the report is: <em>\"</em><em>Despite recent progress, studies on human emotions have been hindered by the lack of consensus on an emotion theory suited to examining the dynamic aspects of emotion and its expression.\"</em><em> </em> Secondly, pure counts of impressions are not the main focus for OOH advertisers. Conversions and durations of impressions are the primary ways by which OOH owners can increase their revenues because that is what is being demanded by advertisers. The ability to know whether or not someone saw an OOH ad and that went into the store is at odds with the current capabilities of the best facial recognition systems that are based on neural/deep networks. According a recent academic study, <em>\" </em><em>When people are wearing a hat, scarf, and glasses to cover their faces… algorithms were able to identify people with around 55 percent accuracy. The figure rose to 69 percent when just glasses were removed.\"</em> (Therefore, tracking in store conversions from out of store becomes difficult, and the ability to track frequency of impressions, conversions, etc. becomes hugely problematic for highly advanced biometric systems, of which I am highly skeptical is available to OOH advertisers at this time.  That said, if the intent is to only collect the number of impressions for a piece of OOH media, camera technology should work for you.  <strong>iBeacon</strong>: iBeacon is a solution that was released by Apple. It has an interesting framework, and Apple's vertical siloed integration amongst its own products is well known and is beneficial to developers. However, this product only works on iBeacon enabled hardware and iOS apps. Furthermore, it requires a user to download an app that has iBeacon integrated into it. Therefore, it has a serious friction point that hinders efficacy, because users have to actively download an app. Efficacy is also hindered because the standard beacon technology has a range of 70 meters. Added to range issues, only 46% of Americans in 2016 owned an iPhone. Therefore, in order for this technology to be of use, an advertiser must be able to have consumers, that own iPhones, who responds to calls of action to download an app.  Not to be confused with all beacon technologies, iBeacon is highly specific and should really only be considered if you know if a majority of your customers have an iPhone. However, if you do have a highly engaged community that has downloaded your app in the past, iBeacon could be an appropriate technology to use.  <strong>Bluetooth collection products</strong>: Beyond the fact that close to 60% of Americans turn off their Bluetooth connections on a regular basis, there are other serious issues with integrating a Bluetooth collection product. The Physical Web beacon protocol that is used in browsers are very basic tools and are currently not supported on Android devices. Secondly, if relying on this protocol, it requires users not to prevent cookies and hashes on their devices or delete or prevent cookies and preferences on their devices. The two main other protocols are iBeacon (as mentioned above) and Eddystone. Currently there is no industry standard and the way that Eddystone works is different on an Android device versus how it works on an Apple device. Range is also a limiting factor with these devices because the standard range for Bluetooth collection products (think beacons) is 70 meters.  If you have development resources or can use a team that is used to working with Eddystone this can be a possible path forward. There are companies that do the integration of these protocols into websites and for some OOH media this can be an appropriate technology. However, for those who want to use technology to track impressions on Billboards, I would suggest not using this technology.  <strong>App based location:</strong> This requires the device's location services to be turned on and the app's location services to be turned on. Furthermore, a user has to download the app and updating the app can present problems if updates are not done in time or the app's architecture changes.  I am highly dubious of purely relying on app based location for the OOH market. There are way too many variables and confidence intervals are huge.  <strong>Passive electronic signature collection</strong>: Passive electronic signature collection comes in many forms. Some technologies use what is known as a man-in-the-middle solution that creates a fake connection point that a cell phone tries to connect to and is immediately denied connection. While not illegal in the United States, this technique presents issues under GDPR. These technologies passively listen for electronic signatures to show the number of impressions. However, because they cannot accurately get to the device’s real address, they are not able to track conversions. <a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/\">Abraxas</a> is different than these types of offerors on the market that passively listen for electronic signatures because we are able to obtain the device’s real address and show conversions in-store and online. The benefit of any passive electronic signature technology is that a user does not need to opt in to or download anything.  If tracking conversions into an advertiser's store or stores is the added value that an OOH owner or media buyer wants to provide, this is a technology that you want to use. Due to the fact that the conversion capability also results in the ability to show the frequency of an impression, OOH owners and media buyers who use this technology have key insights into pricing OOH media. Because Apple and Android both change how they obfuscate devices from time to time, it is important to work with a company that you trust will be able to keep up when Apple and Android put out new protocols to obfuscate their devices.  &nbsp;  Reach out to us today if you want to begin providing relevant data to marketers and advertisers.

This month, the <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/why-toys-r-us-is-closing-stores-2018-3\">announcement</a> that Toys R Us is finally closing all its stores and liquidating all its assets made major headlines. Looking back with <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/toys-r-us-closing-stores-fond-memories-photos-2018-3\">nostalgia</a>, I can’t help but feel a twinge of sadness but as an entrepreneur, I understand that <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/12/what-is-disruptive-innovation\">disruptive innovation</a> is an inevitable reality in the increasingly competitive 21<sup>st</sup> century economy.  Established titans such as Blockbuster Video, Borders Books, Kodak, and Sears have been completely swept away by the gales of “<a href=\"http://www.learnliberty.org/blog/youre-in-joseph-schumpeters-economy-now/\">destructive creation</a>,” in the words of economist Joseph Schumpeter, or have been reduced to shells of their former selves. Brick and mortar retail, in particular, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/05/15/the-gradual-then-sudden-disruption-of-retail/?utm_term=.2581936c833b\">has been hit hard</a> with the advent of ecommerce, and it is not surprising that market leader <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/amp/Business/wireStory/toys-us-joins-bankruptcy-list-amazon-exerts-influence-49965021\">Amazon has claimed another scalp</a> with the fall of Toys R Us.  These on-going trends are consistent with the observations highlighted in Marc Andreessen’s famous 2011 article “<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460\">Why Software Is Eating The World</a>.” <blockquote>We are in the middle of a dramatic and broad technological and economic shift in which software companies are poised to take over large swathes of the economy. More and more major businesses and industries are being run on software and delivered as online services — from movies to agriculture to national defense.</blockquote> The continuing success of Amazon, Netflix, and other tech startups indicate that the software revolution is not over. As more and more companies integrate software into their business models, it is not surprising that data-driven approaches have dramatically transformed traditional marketing strategy. In the case of Netflix, its original hit show <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/70178217\"><em>House of Cards</em></a> was produced and launched through <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/business/media/for-house-of-cards-using-big-data-to-guarantee-its-popularity.html\">collection and analysis of its subscribers’ streaming habits</a>.  Despite all the apps and information available, a November 2017 Google white paper, “<a href=\"https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/google-data-driven-marketers-strategic-playbook.pdf\">The Data-Driven Marketer’s Strategic Playbook</a>, reveals that “61% of marketing decision makers said they still struggled to access or integrate the data they had needed that year.” While nearly 2/3rds of executives in leading companies say that they value data-driven insights over gut intuition, many decision makers “still struggle with data blindness, not knowing what data they have or how it fits together.”  This is a special challenge for out-of-home (OOH) advertising companies. By themselves, billboards (both traditional and digital), bench signs, and other OOH mediums cannot record or provide any meaningful consumer data to advertisers. This significantly impacts an OOH owner’s ability to gain new clients and increase ad spends. Nevertheless, billboards and signage are still very <a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/understanding-technology-options-for-ooh-owners-and-advertisers\">effective when it comes to visibility, reach, and impressions</a>.  Bridging the best of both worlds by integrating capabilities only seen in the online advertising space with the unique characteristics of the Out of Home industry is necessary for the latter’s continued growth (this is exactly why OOH owners are clients of <a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/\">Abraxas Technology</a>). Marketers who know their data from origins to application are best positioned for future success. They should also be willing to not only continue with an existing advertising medium, but also be open to experimenting with new channels and methods. OOH owners and managers who have invested in the proper resources, tools, and personnel necessary to understand and react to sweeping changes in consumer and advertiser behavior and demands will position themselves for market penetration and growth.  For the OOH industry, that means embracing the promise and potential of data analytics. Luckily, there are many <a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/understanding-technology-options-for-ooh-owners-and-advertisers\">technology options out there for OOH owners and advertisers</a>, as highlighted by my colleague Joshua Lawton. While each company’s needs and end goals can widely differ, OOH advertisers must find some way of collecting meaningful data and respond appropriately to changing market conditions. One ignores this landscape at his or her own peril. In the words of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/geoffreyamoore\">Geoffrey Moore</a>, “Without ‘big data’, you are blind and deaf and in the middle of a freeway.” For a company to remain competitive in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, that means adopting the best practices and processes.  As summarized in Google’s <a href=\"https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/google-data-driven-marketers-strategic-playbook.pdf\">white paper</a>: <blockquote>Marketing organizations paving the way have recognized that there are three things that go better together in today’s world: data, that is well-integrated to provide a more complete view of each customer; teams, that increase collaboration, communication, and sharing of data and audience insights; and technology, that unifies analytics and advertising stacks so marketers can deliver more relevant, engaging customer experiences and value to the business.</blockquote> But perhaps most importantly, the best business leaders devote themselves to building organizations with an ingrained culture for continual innovation. With <a href=\"https://www.research.ibm.com/5-in-5/\">artificial intelligence and blockchain</a> likely to become key drivers for the foreseeable future, the impact of emerging technologies on business models will only intensify.  Organizations can’t afford to remain in one fixed state or they will quickly be rendered obsolete and join Blockbuster, Toys R Us, and other dinosaurs in the dust bin of history.  ______________________________________________________________________________  <strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aarontao/\">Aaron Tao</a></strong> is a Product Manager with Abraxas Technology.

Thus, learning about the existence of <a href=\"https://estancia.com/\">Estância Brazilian Steakhouse</a> here in Austin aroused my inner carnivore just like when the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI74fQE--Rs\">very mention of “meat tornado” excited Ron Swanson</a>.  As a regular driver up US-183, I can’t help but look at billboards and lo and behold, I spotted one promising an “authentic” Brazilian steakhouse experience right here in town. Even though I couldn’t go to the restaurant right way, the message of meat stuck in my head. A few weeks later, I spotted another out-of-home (OOH) advertisement, this time on a bus, that tempted me with all-you-can-eat meat prepared with the flavor and culture of Brazil. Still, the busy life of an entrepreneur told my stomach to put its desires on hold. But my dreams became reality within a very short time.  A few days ago, my colleague Joshua Lawton invited me to join him at this very steakhouse for a team celebration dinner: a toast to our <a href=\"https://www.quakecapital.com/blog/abraxas-technology\">recent success</a>. Walking up the steps of Estância Brazilian Steakhouse, I trembled with excitement.  <img class=\"wp-image-655 size-large alignnone\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/EstânciaBrazilianSteakhouse-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />  <img class=\" wp-image-654 alignright\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/REcjjOY.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"496\" height=\"320\" />Needless to say, the evening was a gastronomic delight. Waiters brought out <a href=\"https://estancia.com/menu/meats/\">meat after meat</a> until I could eat no more. House special sirloin, slow-roasted sausage, pork tenderloin, leg of lamb, beef ribs, I had them all. Ron Swanson would have been in heaven.  Speaking as a marketer, I have to commend Estância’s successful OOH advertising campaign in Austin. Their cleverly-placed and attractive ads definitely played a role in piquing my interest, and reflecting on my excellent dining experience, I have no doubt that I will return in the future.  The effectiveness of OOH advertising for the restaurant industry cannot be overstated, as previously <a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/6-points-to-get-ooh-in-the-restaurant-marketing-budget\">highlighted</a> by my colleague Joshua (with a few updated bullets of my own): <ul>  	<li><a href=\"http://www.lamar.com/howtoadvertise/~/media/7845006D467B432592A4A1867BBFBA7D.ashx\">40% of adults</a> who viewed OOH media in the past month visited the restaurant that was advertised.</li>  	<li>Directional billboard advertisements have a serious impact on sales. In one <a href=\"http://www.fliphound.com/files/billboard-out-of-home-advertising-resources/wendys-restaurant-new-location-billboard-campaign-oaaa-case-study.pdf\">study</a>, a Wendy’s directional billboard advertisements increased sales by 32% within the first week of being posted.</li>  	<li><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandratalty/2016/10/17/millennials-spend-44-percent-of-food-dollars-on-eating-out-says-food-institute/#36f4406c3ff6\">According</a> to the Food Institute's analysis of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-expenditures.aspx\">food expenditure data</a> from 2014, Millennials spent 44% of their annual food dollars eating out. Baby Boomers spent 40% of their annual food dollars eating out.</li>  	<li>In spite of rising restaurant prices, <a href=\"https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/partner-with-us/documents/consumer-grocery-spending-highlights.pdf\">people prefer dining out than cooking at home</a>. One analyst in the <i>Harvard Business Review</i> goes so far as to <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/09/the-grocery-industry-confronts-a-new-problem-only-10-of-americans-love-cooking\">predict</a> that grocery shopping and cooking will become a “niche activity that a few people do only some of the time.</li> </ul> With the rise of the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/for-millennials-food-isnt-just-food-its-community/2013/10/22/b6068902-35f2-11e3-8a0e-4e2cf80831fc_story.html?utm_term=.ebf95e463d8c\">foodie culture and community</a>, perhaps it is not surprising that the most exciting innovations in the food and restaurant industries are taking place at the grassroots level. Throughout the country, <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/05/daily-chart-3\">food truck businesses are rapidly expanding</a>. And in the (literal) <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Made-America-Heritage-Cookbook-Contributions/dp/1615828893\">melting pot</a> that showcases the best of Americana, new ethnic food establishments such as <a href=\"http://kemuri-tatsuya.com/\">Kemuri Tatsu-Ya</a> here in Austin are finding a welcome reception by <a href=\"https://austin.eater.com/2017/7/6/15928340/kemuri-tatsu-ya-texas-ramen-brisket-video\">blending Japanese flavors with traditional Texan ingredients such as BBQ brisket</a>.  Texas is already <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/food/texas-food-conquers-the-world/\">world-renowned</a> for its cuisine and that distinction is <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/food/the-food-issue/\">central to our identity</a>. It goes without saying that “<a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/food/the-list-the-top-50-barbecue-joints-in-texas/\">Texas BBQ has no peer on earth</a>.” Salt Lick BBQ is one of central Texas’s most famous BBQ joints. I know of several billboards scattered on freeways that tell drivers which exit to take to reach Salt Lick. People travel here from all over the country to taste some of the best BBQ in the land. For those visitors, a strategically-placed billboard will drive the message home and guide them to their destination.  Given its <a href=\"http://www.reaganoutdoor.com/storage/app/media/ArbitronOutOfHomeAdvertisingStudy.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A6%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C75%2C720%2C0%5D\">well-documented advantages</a>, I have no doubt OOH advertising will continue to play an important role in how restaurants market and brand themselves. Even though they have excellent reach and visibility, billboards and other OOH mediums cannot track the exact number of impressions, duration, and whether those viewers actually visited a restaurant’s physical location. This is where <a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/\">Abraxas Technology</a> comes in. With our proprietary technology and Scout device, we can provide that missing data for OOH owners and advertisers.  For Estância Brazilian Steakhouse, our technology would allow them to perform A/B testing on which billboard locations drive the most traffic to their restaurants. For example, I saw their billboard on US-183 and made the decision to come dine in. Wouldn’t it be great for Estância’s managers to know what other customers saw that specific sign and how many came in compared to advertising venues they may have placed elsewhere?  Non-traditional food businesses such as food trucks also have much to gain from data analytics. Given their mobility, food trucks are in a unique position to spread their reach and visibility. They are not tied down to a brick &amp; mortar location. But nevertheless, their owners would greatly benefit knowing how much visibility and conversions they receive at a particular location compared to others. With Abraxas’s data, that knowledge is attainable. Afterwards, these food trucks will know what locations to return to more often.  For Salt Lick and traditional Texan BBQ joints, a directional billboard definitely helps guide customers to their physical addresses. Then using the analytics provided by Abraxas, the owners can then accurately measure the traffic that resulted in storefront conversions.  At the end of the day, one of the most hyperlocal business industries are restaurants. Their products and services are physical, and the vast majority of their customers come from nearby areas. These characteristics make advertising on billboards one of the most effective mediums for restaurateurs to reach out and entice customers to come to their locations.  As a BBQ lover, Texan, and entrepreneur, I wish Salt Lick and other BBQ joints every bit of success in their marketing campaigns. Let us make them even more effective by equipping billboard owners and advertisers with the data analytics and metrics to ensure the best ROI.  May the message of meat be magnified and be spread far and wide.  ______________________________________________________________________________  <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aarontao/\"><strong>Aaron Tao</strong></a> is a Product Manager with Abraxas Technology.

These same qualities have also brought in the big companies which keep this whole wheel turning for our community. A community that has not even broken a seven-figure <a href=\"https://www.dshs.texas.gov/chs/popdat/ST2017.shtm\">population</a> in the city of Austin.</span>  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With so many companies coming to Austin, our <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.tx_austin_msa.htm#eag_tx_austin_msa.f.p\">unemployment</a> rate is 3% as of February 2018. This is amazing for the economics of the city and the workers who live in Central Texas. Every resource is subject to the <a href=\"http://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2007/Robertsprices.html\">law of supply and demand</a> and the demand for capable employees in Austin often outstrips in the short term the supply. This has created a need for companies who are looking to hire in Austin to offer higher wages and benefit packages. </span>  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a growing startup, at Abraxas we understand that we are in competition with better funded and much more established companies. I know that we are not the only startup that is growing and looking to find top talent. Therefore, I wanted to outline a few different ways that we at Abraxas have used to attract the right talent without going belly up.</span> <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With any competition, where does that leave the bootstrapped and funded startup?</span></h2> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest weapon in your toolbox is the dream of your company. It is the same dream you have to sell to investors, customers, and now to your potential employees. Once again with any risk, there needs to be a reward. Some of your most talented workers have probably been in larger corporations for so long that they may want to take an adventure. Everyone dreams of glory in their own way, it is up to you to show them how they can hit that mark by coming to work with you. At the same time, there are a lot of people, due to financial responsibilities, cannot afford to take a serious risk. Making sure that you are attracting candidates who can handle the risks that are associated with a startup is key to making sure that the candidate is going to be a good fit for your company and that your company is going to be a good fit for the candidate. </span> <h2 class=\"h1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/research/studies/benefits-drive-employee-satisfaction/\">\"Which Benefits Drive Employee Satisfaction?\"</a></h2> &nbsp;  <img class=\"wp-image-686 alignleft\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GD_BenefitRatings_DriveSatisfaction_Final.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"413\" height=\"388\" />  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">                                                                                                                    Healthcare is the se</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ond hammer in your toolbox to really get the star talent you need to grow. This seems like a potentially huge undertaking to offer benefits but there have been some great steps in making health care benefits accessible to small com</span>panies and startups. So I want to outline the basics and a few of the plans we reviewed (for our employees) to help you get that talent.  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those who do not even know the basics, (don't worry, I didn't either when I first started out), you have to offer <a href=\"http://www.healthlawguideforbusiness.org/employer-responsibility\">healthcare benefits</a> to all “full-time employees” of your company and make sure you are compliant at all times with appropriate state and local laws (We're in Austin, so you better be prepared). This doesn't mean that everyone has to take the bene</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fits you offer (they can waive their coverage for your company). </span>  &nbsp;  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cost of coverage will range on multiple factors. Depending on which healthcare plan an individual employee selects, costs to the company can range from 40-75% of the employee's premium. For example, if my plan costs $1,000 a month, Abraxas would cover up to $750. Most coverage for a person in their 20-30s will fall around $200-$600 that the company will cover per employee. Costs will vary mostly depending on the plans you offer and the age of the employee.</span>  <a href=\"https://gusto.com/product/benefits\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-687\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Health-care-plan-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"554\" height=\"482\" /></a>  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This snapshot is of the normal plan of copays and what the average cost for each plan would be. The summary of all these plans look great, but some of these plans cost $2,300 per day if you go into the emergency room and it does NOT go towards your deductible. When reading through the whole plan, look at these key items as they can cost the most: facility fees, outpatient services, inpatient services and drug level. These items can be found in the SBC provided by each coverage.</span>  <a href=\"https://www.vista360health.com/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-688\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Health-plan-picture-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"456\" height=\"397\" /></a>  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is another common plan that we have looked at. These types of plans offer 50% copay, which shifts most of the costs to the employee. </span>  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What it boils down to is that you need to make up the risk by providing the most benefits you can. For one of the top plans, it's going to cost your company $30,000 a year for 8 employees but it can be a key differentiator between your startup and the other startups vying for top talent. </span>  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.consciouscapitalism.org/\">Conscience Capitalism</a> is a term that is often thrown around in Austin, but when you look across Austin's startup landscape it isn't as prevalent in practice as it is in voice. Beyond the social and cultural reasons, we believe at Abraxas Technology that it is important to take care of our employees. We know (<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghanbiro/2014/01/19/happy-employees-hefty-profits/#8b77c4e221a8\">and studies show</a>) that it is good business to take care of our talented employees.

These applications can range from the amusing to potentially life-saving. From its analysis of online interactions between couples, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/data/\">Facebook Data Science</a> can predict with astounding accuracy the likelihood of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-data-science/the-formation-of-love/10152064609253859\">budding relationships</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-data-science/when-love-goes-awry/10152066701893859/?fref=mentions\">break ups</a>. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/05/170509121952.htm\">Using Twitter data</a>, researchers at Northeastern University developed a model to accurately predict flu outbreaks up to six weeks in advance.  Data analytics is being used by more and more companies to allow them to make better decisions, develop new products and services, and verify or refute existing theories or models. <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/capturing-value-from-your-customer-data\">According to McKinsey research</a>, “organizations that leverage customer behavioral insights outperform peers by 85 percent in sales growth and more than 25 percent in gross margin.” Perhaps then it is no surprise that some of the most innovative products, services, processes, and solutions were developed by companies that successfully leveraged and applied the customer insights that came from big data.  The names of companies who have outperformed their peers through data are now household names. Amazon, Google and Netflix have all successfully used data to understand, market to, and increase revenue from their customers. Guided by its mission statement to become “<a href=\"http://delight.us/earths-most-customer-centric-company/\">Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company</a>,” Amazon is currently one of today’s <a href=\"http://fortune.com/worlds-most-admired-companies/amazon-com/\">most admired companies</a> (in addition to enjoying an impressive <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/AMZN/free_cash_flow\">$7.4 billion free cash flow as of December 2017</a>). Google, now known as Alphabet, makes <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/020515/business-google.asp\">90% of its $89.5 billion revenue from Google Adwords</a>. <a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/how-netflix-uses-analytics/\">Drawing on data analytics that combed through subscribers’ viewing habits and gathered valuable insights</a>, Netflix produced heavily personalized content and became the biggest streaming service in the United States.  Amazon, Google, and Netflix may all have different business models but all three of these tech titans built their vast empires with a core focus on customer behavior data and analytics. Clayton Christensen, author of the best-selling classic <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Technologies-Management-Innovation/dp/1633691780/\"><em>The Innovator’s Dilemma</em></a>, has taken pains to point out that customers aren’t really interested in products or services themselves but in what they do, specifically “<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done\">jobs to be done</a>.” Christensen further elaborates: <blockquote>Identifying and understanding the job to be done are only the first steps in creating products that customers want—especially ones they will pay premium prices for. It’s also essential to create the right set of experiences for the purchase and use of the product and then integrate those experiences into a company’s processes.</blockquote> Successful companies such as Amazon, Google, and Netflix know that they have to go beyond knowing “who” their customers are. Specifically, they rely on data analytics as revealed through their customers’ behaviors to obtain a more accurate picture of what they really want and need, and how and when to best deliver it to them.  For the out-of-home (OOH) advertising industry, the landscape has remained virtually unchanged since the 1990s. While OOH advertising still possesses many advantages and is <a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/you-wont-believe-why-which-advertising-medium-is-forecasted-to-grow-the-fastest\">positioned to grow</a>, OOH mediums cannot record or provide any meaningful consumer data to advertisers. These shortcomings severely limit an OOH owner’s ability to gain new customers and increase ad spends. In today’s economy, companies are constantly reinventing themselves through customer-centricity, personalization, and customer experience. Data-driven analytics and quantitative insights are the must-have tools.  The key takeaway for OOH owners is that in order for them to increase their revenue and amount of ad spend within a marketing campaign, they cannot just rely on the number of weekly impressions. They also have to provide qualitative data that allows for marketers to gain a deeper understanding of consumers’ motivations, context, and triggers. Having grown used to the data that online marketing platforms provide, marketers and advertisers are now demanding the same from the OOH market (traits that we at <a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/\">Abraxas Technology</a> have built into our product).  From the surveys and interviews that we have conducted at Abraxas Technology, the number one qualitative attribute that marketers and advertisers need before increasing their ad spends with OOH owners is knowing which billboards are producing results for their campaigns. This requires data showing customer conversions from the billboards to the store.  Industries unable or too slow to apply customer-centric, behavioral data-driven strategies in their business models will be at greater risk of <a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/dont-get-blown-away-by-the-gale-of-creative-destruction\">obsolescence</a>. Owners and advertisers who have access to customer data and understand their behavior can then effectively make use of their ad spend and position themselves for future market expansion. Ultimately, OOH owners have to join the 21<sup>st</sup> century in order to remain successful companies.  ______________________________________________________________________________  <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aarontao/\"><strong>Aaron Tao</strong></a> is a Product Manager with Abraxas Technology.

While Ireland is both small in relative terms of GDP and population, as a tax haven for many American tech companies, the ability of Helen Dixon, Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner to “slap companies with fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue — which for Facebook could mean penalties of up to </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/why-europe-not-congress-will-rein-in-big-tech/2018/04/14/a39c8cd8-2e33-11e8-8dc9-3b51e028b845_story.html?utm_term=.e8931cbf2def\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$1.6 billion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.” is going to create a trickle down environment that will affect American businesses. </span>  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though there are numerous real obstacles to the European Union guaranteeing digital privacy </span><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21739997-europeans-asking-facebook-their-data-run-maze-obstacles-eu-guarantees-its\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rights</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, these obstacles have not prevented companies and US states from taking up the mantle of protecting digital privacy rights. California, the highest GDP state in the USA, has recently approved the </span><a href=\"https://www.caprivacy.org/about\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California Consumer Privacy Act</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to be on their November ballot. While less restrictive than GDPR, it holds several key provisions that, if passed, will affect everything from digital advertising to programmatic buying:</span> <ul>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gives consumers right to learn categories of personal information that businesses collect, sell, or disclose about them, and to whom information is sold or disclosed. </span></li>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gives consumers right to prevent businesses from selling or disclosing their personal information</span></li> </ul> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, since neither the California Consumer Privacy Act has been passed nor is GDPR the law of the land in the United States many companies are trying to figure out just what they should consider to be Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Unfortunately, the summary provided by the European Union itself on what it considers to be PII is broad:</span>  &nbsp; <h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Any information related to a natural person or ‘Data Subject’, that can be used to directly or indirectly identify the person. It can be anything from a name, a photo, an email address, bank details, posts on social networking websites, medical information, or a computer IP address.”</span></i></h4> &nbsp;  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, for OOH owners and media buyers, it is important to understand that GDPR’s sole focus beyond consumers owning and knowing what is happening with their data is the ability to identify natural persons by bringing together specific identifiers. the online identifiers specifically mentioned in GDPR. Recital 30 of the GDPR clarifies that natural persons may be identified with online identifiers which are provided</span><a href=\"https://www.i-scoop.eu/gdpr/gdpr-personal-data-identifiers-pseudonymous-information/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</span> <ul>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Devices,</span></li>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Applications,</span></li>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tools and</span></li>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Protocols, such as</span></li>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IP (Internet Protocol) addresses,</span></li>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cookie identifiers, or others such as</span></li>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags (which brings us to the Internet of Things).</span></li> </ul> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recital 30 is going to make it problematic for data companies that have not taken our approach at </span><a href=\"http://www.abraxastechnology.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abraxas Technology</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to focus on being in compliance with GDPR to revamp their collection and data structure to be in compliance with GDPR. This means that for both media buyers and OOH owners who rely on data to make pricing and buying decisions, they are going to have to look to different means to do so in the OOH industry. That said, GDPR could be a boon for the OOH industry by leveling the data playing field. The one common complaint by advertisers and marketers is that the OOH industry lacks the wealth of data that they are able to obtain online from companies like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. If these companies are no longer able to provide the same data to marketers and advertisers moving forward, the gap between the OOH industry’s and the online advertising industry’s ad spends could be narrowed significantly. </span>  &nbsp;  Email <a href=\"mailto:JLawton@abraxastechnology.com\">JLawton@abraxastechnology.com </a>today if you want to begin providing relevant data to marketers and advertisers to increase their ad spends on your boards.

Decked out in pictures of adorable puppies, this van advertised the services for <a href=\"https://www.mypetsmvp.com/\">MyPetsMVP.com</a>, a mobile veterinary practice. Even though I currently do not own a pet (my future dream is to buy a Texas ranch so I can raise a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lqhleCf8R0\">capybara</a>), this clever ad placement intrigued me enough to look up their website once I reached my computer. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this veterinary clinic lives up to its name and brings its services to your pet at home akin to a <a href=\"https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/05/08/early-uber-engineer-launches-pager-a-doctor-makes-house-call-app/\">traditional house call</a> (which some tech startups are trying to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/startups-vie-to-build-an-uber-for-health-care-1439265847\">revitalize using the Uber business model</a>) for us humans.  With Austin rated as one of America’s <a href=\"https://www.statesman.com/lifestyles/pets/welcome-dogtown-aka-austin-texas/GXzyLzZSKTCvnBV40lICwL/\">best dog-friendly cities</a> in addition to having the <a href=\"http://pets.blog.austin360.com/2017/04/07/austin-has-third-highest-rate-of-pet-ownership-in-u-s-survey-says/\">third-highest rate of pet ownership in the entire country</a>, perhaps then it is not surprising that an entrepreneurial venture like <a href=\"https://www.mypetsmvp.com/\">MyPetsMVP.com</a> with a customer-centric business model would find great success here.  Just as the human healthcare system is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4714455/\">plagued by missed appointments</a>, veterinary practices also experience this major pain point. <a href=\"https://blog.petdesk.com/what-pesky-no-shows-actually-cost-you\">According to PetDesk</a>, an 11% no-show rate (data obtained from 250 animal clinics in 2014) translates into $41,250 of lost revenue for one full-time veterinarian booking 3,000 appointments per year with an average $125 revenue per appointment. A mobile veterinary clinic would have the advantage of bringing services and treatment directly to the patient in addition to enjoying the <a href=\"http://www.reaganoutdoor.com/storage/app/media/ArbitronOutOfHomeAdvertisingStudy.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A6%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C75%2C720%2C0%5D\">advantages of out-of-home advertising (OOH)</a>.  A traditional highway billboard or a mobile billboard in the form of wrap advertising on vehicles has excellent reach and visibility. The latter may be even more effective. <a href=\"http://www.truckinginfo.com/channel/equipment/article/story/2017/07/mobile-truck-and-van-marketing.aspx\">According to the American Trucking Association</a>, “a vehicle wrap on a typical trailer makes 10 million impressions every year.” Furthermore, a <a href=\"https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/566528O/street-smart-selling.pdf\">study</a> by ad agency RYP &amp; Becker Group found that: <ul>  	<li>97 percent of survey respondents recalled the ad on the truck.</li>  	<li>98 percent thought the ads created a positive image of the advertiser.</li>  	<li>96 percent thought fleet graphics had more impact than billboards.</li> </ul> Now combine these advantages with the <a href=\"https://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/wired-that-way/the-science-of-cute\">cuteness effect</a>. Few people are able to resist looking at images of cute animals given the proliferation of <a href=\"http://www.lolcats.com/\">lolcats</a> and baby <a href=\"http://www.dorkly.com/post/64544/the-20-greatest-meme-animals-of-all-time\">animal memes</a> online. Researchers have documented that cuteness can trigger a wide range of positive feelings including <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/2016/08/23/how-cute-baby-animal-photos-toy-with-your-brain/rwGloNTkjYzKnP5UmW2ETL/story.html\">happiness</a>, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-cute-things-hijack-our-brains-and-drive-behaviour-61942\">pleasure</a>, and even <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0046362\">greater focus and attention to detail</a>.  I have no doubt that I wasn’t the only person that day who saw MyPetsMVP’s van and smiled.  Despite these advantages, vehicular wrap advertising and other OOH mediums have inherent limitations. They cannot track the exact number of impressions, duration, and whether those viewers visited the advertised clinic (analytics that we at <a href=\"http://www.abraxastechnology.com\">Abraxas Technology</a> have teamed up with OOH owners to provide).  With three dog owners (and a future capybara rancher) on our team, we love helping OOH owners deliver to value to veterinarians so that they can better connect with potential clients: pet owners.  ______________________________________________________________________________  <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aarontao/\"><b>Aaron Tao</b></a> is a Product Manager with Abraxas Technology.

This shift in ad spends is going to have a significant impact on an industry that has a hyperlocal market and is impacted by regulatory restrictions. When you combine these factors with the traditional real estate value creator of location, creating valuable new supply as demand increases is problematic. Furthermore, even with the expansion of digital out of home platforms, DOOH still only makes up 5% of the total OOH market. </span>  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, taking into account the previous effects of data on the digital market, what forecasting shows is that downward pressure is going to be exercised against the digital market while the OOH market’s value is going to be lifted by innovation in physical data that will provide relevance to advertisers and media buyers and create increased ad spending by them combined with the depreciating value of the data that the digital market contains. </span>  <img class=\" wp-image-756 aligncenter\" src=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-03-at-11.44.38-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"658\" height=\"351\" />  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to reap the rewards of an increased ad spend by media buyers and advertisers, OOH owners need to position themselves to not solely rely on location or weekly impressions, because national advertisers are going to have different ROI data requirements than local buyers. According to Darin Plautz of Waitt Outdoor, national buyers already want data that can help them determine “Which locations had higher demand and distribution throughout a region.” This demand for data that surpasses weekly impressions will only increase and trickle down to local buyers, which presents a problem for OOH owners because the tools that they rely on are not providing them with the data they need to increase revenue (something that we do at </span><a href=\"http://www.abraxastechnology.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abraxas Technology</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). A common complaint expressed by multiple individuals interviewed for this article was surmised by Andrew Greenwald of Gigantic Media, “Geopath and their tools don’t really make a good case for local buys.” </span>  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The one truth in business is, if you stop evolving you die.

This negative view of GDPR compliance stems from the fact that penalties for non-compliance are severe, many companies (including many industry leaders) have a business model that effectively requires the use and sale of personal data to stay afloat, and we generally don’t like it when Europeans tell us Americans what to do.  </span>  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this negative view is all wrong because we absolutely </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">should</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have control over our data, and the public, along with European lawmakers, aren’t asking companies to do anything terribly drastic to substantially improve the balance between our privacy rights and the use of our personal data for business or public service purposes.</span>  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the most basic level, GDPR compliance asks companies to become aware of the importance of any personal data it collects or processes, and then to treat it with some tender loving care.  </span>  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To implement this principle, GDPR regulations set forth a “</span><a href=\"https://gdpr-info.eu/chapter-3/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bill of privacy rights</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” that includes the right to: </span> <ul>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">be informed about the collection and use of personal data   </span></li>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">access personal data</span></li>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rectify incorrect data or complete an incomplete data set</span></li>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">be forgotten (i.e. erase personal data)</span></li>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">restrict or suppress processing of data</span></li>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">obtain and reuse data, portably, across multiple services</span></li>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">object to processing data for certain purposes like email marketing</span></li>  	<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">be protected against improper automated decision-making that uses personal data</span></li> </ul> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help make this conversation more tangible and put these rights in context, let’s for a moment imagine that your phone number is a piece of personal data (it is, by the way) that may be held by an internet retailer that processes your data.</span>  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this moment, we already have </span><a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47/part-52/subpart-C\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">laws in place</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that allow us to protect our phone number, or take it with us if we switch service providers, just like the GDPR requirements, and we’ve had these laws for many years already!  So if a phone number is important enough to protect, so should our address and email address, let alone even more personal information like our health records. As organizations scramble to comply with GDPR regulations, </span><a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/privacy-laws\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CA regulations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/BC/htm/BC.521.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TX regulation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s, and </span><a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/guidance-materials-for-consumers/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GDPR-adjacent American laws</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> such as HIPAA protections, we encourage companies to be thoughtful, transparent, and committed to the principles behind these laws, as much as the laws themselves. In taking that approach, an abstract and mystifying compliance landscape that isn’t even official until the end of this month will become more approachable. </span>  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To us, the proper approach to data security compliance is to treat it like a routine practice, grounded in self-awareness of what our organization is doing, and constantly evaluating our position and working to improve upon it, much like a yoga practice or achieving a better golf score. It is this pursuit of doing the right thing that sets us off in a positive direction for compliance and helps us avoid chasing waterfalls.</span>  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, Abraxas isn’t a European company, no we don’t want your number (unless you give it to us so we can contact you), and no, we don’t collect data that is readily used to identify any of you or any individual human being, and it would be possible for us to argue that these laws don’t even apply to us, but ultimately why argue when we agree with the concept that your data belongs to you, and that you should have the ability to make your wishes known regarding how your data is used. </span>  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are </span><a href=\"https://www.iep.utm.edu/property/#H4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">principles</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> already woven into the </span><a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/privacy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fabric of our legal system</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and our society, and we wish to embrace these principles, not hide from them!  For example, from a privacy law standpoint, we recognize that who we are, and the data surrounding who are already enjoys substantial </span><a href=\"https://content.next.westlaw.com/6-502-0467?transitionType=Default&amp;firstPage=true&amp;bhcp=1&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">legal protection</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, especially when that data is stored or transmitted by computers.  Also, from an intellectual property standpoint, we can find a nice analogy from the world of copyright law, where it is well-settled that </span><a href=\"https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-protect.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">facts are not copyrightable</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.  </span>  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, how exactly do we incorporate all of this into our business? Simple:</span> <ul>  	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We practice what we preach. We seek to provide a comprehensive and insightful set of user-facing legal documents that explains what data we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have in relation to any data we may have.</span></li>  	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We only collect what we need, nothing more. Data collection is not supposed to be an excuse to rummage through your photos and contact list, it is supposed to be a precision-guided process where care is taken to be mindful of privacy concerns and only collecting the data needed to achieve our business goals of providing OOH advertisers with insights regarding impressions, dwell time, and conversions, three of the most important metrics for any advertisement.</span></li>  	<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through our creation of these metrics for OOH advertising, we are providing an oasis for advertisers thirsty for a real choice in advertising that delivers the </span><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/03/advertising-analytics-20\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">insights of online advertising</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, without the drawbacks of privacy invasions or ad creep.</span></li> </ul> &nbsp;  <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have any questions about GDPR and data privacy please do not hesitate to contact us at  <a href=\"mailto:JLawton@abraxastechnology.com\">JLawton@abraxastechnology.com</a>.</span>  &nbsp;  Brad Gold is the Data Privacy Officer at Abraxas Technology  &nbsp;  <i>Follow us on Twitter </i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Abraxas_Tech\"><i>@</i><b><i>Abraxas_Tech</i></b></a>",

In her annual <a href=\"http://billboardinsider.com/nancy-fletcher-state-of-the-industry-speech-at-go2018/\">State of the Industry speech</a>, OAAA President and CEO <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nfletcherOAAA\">Nancy Fletcher</a> highlighted several significant trends: <blockquote>While OOH revenue is growing, share is stuck at 4 percent. Data analytics are transforming every corner of our industry…. In this age of disruption, the future of OOH is going to be very different, whether we’re talking about measurement, data analytics, or automated buying and selling. We’re seeing new platforms and products, along with new competition, from outside our industry….  [An] important way we prove the value of OOH is through accurate industry statistics. One of the most important of these is ad spend data. Advertisers, trade press, and investors use ad spend data to inform their business decisions, so we want OOH to appear accurately and in the best possible light.</blockquote> From our conversations with many industry insiders who visited our booth (and from previous market research), we learned that obtaining accurate ad spend data is one of the greatest challenges facing OOH owners and advertisers. Furthermore, many of them echoed Fletcher’s concerns regarding revenue stagnation.  Many marketers have turned to online advertising platforms such as <a href=\"https://adwords.google.com/home/\">Google AdWords</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/products/ads\">Facebook</a> because they can directly control their budget, target their ads to a broad or specific demographic as they want, and most importantly, obtain ad spend data to calculate ROI. But this is a temporary bandage on a dam that’s about to burst. When the European Union’s <a href=\"https://www.eugdpr.org/\">General Data Privacy Regulation</a> (GDPR) goes into effect, many analysts and industry insiders <a href=\"https://adzerk.com/blog/2018/01/gdpr-and-ad-tech/\">expect online advertising spend to take a major hit</a>.  Given uncertain market conditions, it’s very easy for advertisers to get confused and determine what will be most effective marketing channel for future investment. Understandably, many OOH owners choose to stay the course and stick to business as usual.  For decades, the OOH industry standard to determine the effectiveness of an ad is to count the number of impressions. However, as most digital marketers well know, <a href=\"https://adalysis.com/blog/inside-ad-testing-metrics-conversion-per-impression-cpi/\">impressions rarely translate into conversions</a>. To make matters worse, many OOH advertisers receive impression data that is out of date (especially if they rely on census data which is collected every 10 years…). Of all the available sources and tracking methods, ranging from daily effective circulation to travel surveys, none them can provide real-time customer metrics and behavior analytics.  Abraxas Technology was founded for this very reason to address this major market pain. OOH advertising is still king in terms of reach, visibility, and <a href=\"http://oaaa.org/portals/0/Public%20PDFs/Outlook%20Newsletter/OutdoorOutlook_050718.pdf\">room for future growth</a>. With our proprietary technology, we combine the <a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/converting-non-believers-5-points-to-support-out-of-home-advertising\">advantages of OOH</a> with the real-time metrics and analytics of digital marketing.  <a href=\"http://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/\">Google Analytics</a> is a powerful tool for businesses to obtain online customer behavioral data. In the right hands, a marketer can answer essential questions such as: <ul>  	<li style=\"text-align: left;\">How many people visit my website?</li>  	<li style=\"text-align: left;\">What websites send traffic to my website?</li>  	<li style=\"text-align: left;\">What marketing tactics drive the most traffic to my website?</li>  	<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Which pages on my website are the most popular?</li>  	<li style=\"text-align: left;\">How many visitors have I converted into leads or customers?</li>  	<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Where did my converting visitors come from and go on my website?</li> </ul> Many OOH advertisers and owners strongly desire similar insights for their marketing campaigns. That is now a possibility with Abraxas’s technology. We provide an online dashboard similar to Google Analytics to help users accurately determine the most valuable advertising locations and times of day, and measure advertisement effectiveness by correlating views with consumer behavior.  From this dashboard, an OOH advertiser or owner can gain unique insights into their customers: <ul>  	<li>Accurately measure impressions, frequency, and exposure duration time.</li>  	<li>Conduct A/B testing with real-time data.</li>  	<li>Measure traffic and storefront conversions.</li> </ul> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td><b>Benefits for Advertisers</b></td> <td><b>Benefits for Billboard Owners</b></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <ul>  	<li>Access to real-time data and analytics to identify the best media.</li>  	<li>Access to ABRAXAS’s proprietary data to make your media spend more effective.</li>  	<li>Correlate ad engagements with in-store traffic.</li> </ul> </td> <td> <ul>  	<li>Improved validation can yield increased ad-spends of up to 20%.</li>  	<li>Identify which billboards are most effective for each advertiser.</li>  	<li>Increase revenue channels by becoming a reseller.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Last but not least, <a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/gdpr-embrace-it-dont-fear-it\">Abraxas developed its technology in compliance with GDPR standards</a> to prepare for the future landscape. Abraxas customers may rest assured that they will have the best data analytics platform optimized for the post-GDPR world.  As Nancy Fletcher correctly stated in her speech, obtaining accurate ad spend data is the next major challenge for the OOH industry in the 21st Century. Abraxas is excited to be here at the right time! We’d love to empower OOH owners and advertisers with the means to stay competitive in our increasingly data-driven economy.  ______________________________________________________________________________  <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aarontao/\"><b>Aaron Tao</b></a> is a Product Manager with Abraxas Technology.

                "contentEncoded": "In 2017, out of home (OOH) advertising spending reached <a href=\"https://oaaa.org/StayConnected/NewsArticles/IndustryRevenue/tabid/322/id/5232/Default.aspx\">$7.7 billion, an all-time record.</a> Against the backdrop of traditional media decline, OOH and the technology sectors have formed a symbiotic relationship.<a href=\"https://oaaa.org/StayConnected/NewsArticles/IndustryRevenue/tabid/322/id/5232/Default.aspx\"> According</a> to the Outdoor Advertising Association of America (OAAA) President & CEO Nancy Fletcher, <q>OOH is growing because it complements digital media by priming search, mobile and social engagement.</q> <br> Four of <a href=\"https://oaaa.org/AboutOOH/Factsamp;Figures/TopOOHAdvertisers.aspx\">the top 10 OOH advertisers</a> are tech companies: Amazon, Apple, Google, \n and Verizon. Netflix is number 11, and recently made a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-regencyoutdoor-m-a-netflix/netflix-offering-more-than-300-million-for-billboard-company-sources-idUSKCN1HD1FK\">bid to purchase a major billboard company in Los Angeles</a>. With <a href=\"https://adzerk.com/blog/2018/01/gdpr-and-ad-tech/\">digital advertising wells drying up thanks to GDPR</a>, all those marketing dollars have to go somewhere. The tech industry has already invested heavily in OOH advertising, and given the new legal landscape,<a href=\"https://thoughtleadership.oaaa.org/oohsurge/\"> OOH spending will surge even more</a>. <br> \n Billboards are still the <a href=\"http://oaaa.org/Portals/0/Public%20PDFs/F&F%20-%20OOH%20by%20Format%20Pie%20Chart%20-%20YE%202017.pdf\">dominant outlet in OOH advertising</a>, and for good reasons. Billboards have <a href=\"http://www.reaganoutdoor.com/storage/app/media/ArbitronOutOfHomeAdvertisingStudy.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A6%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C75%2C720%2C0%5D\"> great reach and visibility </a>, and are unaffected by the many issues that handicap online ads. A billboard cannot be blocked, skipped, or taken over by bots. Furthermore, billboards are unaffected by the GDPR crackdown on the collection and use of customer data. <br> It makes sense for OOH advertisers to take advantage of those opportunities and even experiment with a variant: the mobile billboard, which the OAAA <a href=\"https://oaaa.org/AboutOOH/OOHBasics/OOHGlossaryofTerms.aspx#m\">defines </a> as a <q>truck equipped with one or more poster panel units. The truck can either be parked at specified venues or driven around designated localities.</q> <br> <a href=\"https://www.truckinginfo.com/157526/importance-of-mobile-truck-van-marketing\">According to the American Trucking Association </a>, “a vehicle wrap on a typical trailer makes 10 million impressions every year.” Furthermore, a <a href=\"https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/566528O/street-smart-selling.pdf\">study </a> by ad agency RYP & Becker Group found that: <ul> <li>97 percent of survey respondents recalled the ad on the truck.</li> <li>98 percent thought the ads created a positive image of the advertiser. </li> <li>96 percent thought fleet graphics had more impact than billboards.</li></ul> <br> Recently, the Abraxas team interviewed Rod Collins, the CEO & Founder of <a href=\"https://bulldogbillboards.com/about-bulldog-mobile-billboards/\">Bulldog Mobile Billboards</a> who elaborated in-depth on the advantages of mobile billboard advertising:<em><q> The ability to have a mobile billboard near to a retail location provides significant lift to in-store conversions and efficacy of the advertising campaign, because it is a significant highlight of the advertiser's physical location.</q></em> <br> Mobile billboards are also more customer-centric than traditional stationary billboards. Mr. Collins proudly recounts that <q>my clients provide me with the routes and demographics that they want to advertise to.</q> With custom targeting, mobile billboards are able to mimic a key feature of online advertising: the ability to target ads to a broad or specific demographic as the marketer wants by geographic location. <br> The last part of the equation though is still missing: knowing an OOH advertising campaign’s ROI because OOH owners are unable to state which impressions converted into the advertiser’s store (what <a href=\"http://abraxastechnology.com/#/\">Abraxas Technology</a> is the best-in-breed at doing). <br> With the convergence of traditional OOH and the digital realms, it is only natural for OOH advertisers and owners to desire real-time analytics for their marketing campaigns. <br> Abraxas Technology was founded for very purpose of bridging the best of both worlds. OOH advertising is still king in terms of reach, visibility, and <a href=\"http://oaaa.org/portals/0/Public%20PDFs/Outlook%20Newsletter/OutdoorOutlook_050718.pdf\"> room for future growth </a>. With our proprietary technology, we combine the advantages of OOH with the real-time metrics and analytics of digital marketing to measure actual conversations. <br> Specifically, we provide an online dashboard similar to Google Analytics to OOH owners and advertisers to help them determine the most valuable advertising locations and times of day, and measure advertisement effectiveness by correlating views with consumer behavior. For a mobile billboard advertiser, this is a dream come true given trucks can cover vast areas with different customer demographics. <br> Using the Abraxas dashboard, a mobile advertiser gains unique insights into customers: <ul> <li>Accurately measure impressions, frequency, and exposure duration time.</li> <li>Conduct A/B testing with real-time data.</li> <li>Measure traffic and storefront conversions.</li></ul>  <table> <tr><th ><br>Benefits for Mobile Billboard Advertisers<br></th><th ><br>  Benefits for Mobile Billboard (Truck) Owners<br></th></tr><tr><td ><ul><li>Access to real-time data and analytics to identify the best media.</li> <li>Access to ABRAXAS’s proprietary data to make your media spend more effective.</li> <li>Correlate ad engagements with in-store traffic.</li></ul></td><td ><ul><li>Improved validation can yield increased ad-spends of up to 20%.</li><li>Identify which billboards are most effective for each advertiser.</li><li>Increase revenue channels by becoming a reseller.</li></ul></td></tr></table> <br> As Rod Collins correctly stated, mobile billboards are uniquely positioned to boost a brick & mortar store’s profile when they are close to its physical location. Now they can be made even more effective when data analytics reveal the specific number of conversions as a result of that ad. <br> Let us here at Abraxas make that a reality!   ______________________________________________________________________________ <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aarontao/\"><b>Aaron Tao</b></a> is a Product Manager with Abraxas Technology.

For those privacy advocates and conscientious consumers who thought that Cambridge Analytica was the bottom of the ethical barrel, Facebook announced recently that they shared European and American user data with a Chinese corporation that US intelligence services allege is tied to the Chinese <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/27/vermont-passes-first-first-law-to-crack-down-on-data-brokers\">government.</a> While it is unknown to what extent Americans’ and Europeans’ personal data is now stored within the confines of the Chinese Communist Party’s servers, the revelation only spurs on additional efforts to add on to the already hefty GDPR regulations to restrict unlimited data collection and sharing that has been the status quo of digital advertisers. From the recent passing of Vermont’s data broker <a href=\"https://www.caprivacy.org/\">law </a>,  , to the upcoming referendum in California to pass the <a href=\"https://www.marketingtechnews.net/news/2018/jun/05/apple-takes-aim-facebook-user-tracking-features/\">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> the trend of limiting access and the sharing of personal consumer data will continue unabated. <br> While the conversation has mostly centered around what was done or is presumed could be done with this data, a review of how these laws will affect the value of the data that digital marketers use has been rather mute. However, the impacts are going to be widespread and have a profound impact on digital marketing. But these impacts are not just going to be felt from a regulatory standpoint, tech companies like Apple are taking aim at adding significant privacy tools that will disrupt Facebook’s data collection <a href=\"https://www.marketingtechnews.net/news/2018/jun/05/apple-takes-aim-facebook-user-tracking-features/\"> capabilities. </a> Companies are also going to have to severely limit their ability to collect behavioral data, a mainstay dependency of marketers for over a <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/05/how-gdpr-will-transform-digital-marketing\"> decade</a>.  . Compounding this limitation is the illegality of using automated decision making which will have a significant impact on the efficacy of driving inferences and targeting and re-targeting ads. <br><br> All of this means that rather than continuing on its astounding upward market value creation, the $59B online marketing industry is going to contract and that money, searching for a place to find value, is going to go to the one market that does not rely on creating natural person profiles to validate ad spends: the Out of Home market. OOH market’s value is going to be lifted by innovation in physical data that will provide relevance to advertisers and media buyers and create increased ad spending by them combined with the depreciating value of the data that the digital market contains. This means that for billboard owners they will see increasing revenue due to the devaluation of the digital space. <img src='https://image.ibb.co/i52dsy/marketvalue.png'/>"

                "contentEncoded": "Mobile billboards are a highly valuable medium for direct advertising to a specific sub-segment of consumers, and yet it is underserved by companies and nonprofits who provide data to the out-of-home industry. While this should come as no surprise to those who know that mobile billboards account for a fraction of the total available boards within the out-of-home industry, it is an oversight of a growing and highly active section of the out of home industry that requires correction to increase revenue and spur on the growth of mobile billboard companies.<br> Beyond the fact that mobile billboards have a lower CPM than static billboards and that mobile billboards have a 7% higher recall rate than static billboards, a mobile billboard also have a higher conversion into the advertiser’s store than static billboards. This is quintessentially important, because according to a 300 person survey conducted by us at Abraxas Technology, the number one ROI measurement that media buyers, agencies, and local advertisers want to see is if their OOH campaigns are increasing sales. The number two ROI measurement that these same people want to see is if an OOH campaign actually causes people to go to the website or into the advertiser’s store. When asked if they equate conversion with increased sales, 80% of them said <q>Yes</q>. <br> Yet, just like the rest of the out of home industry, mobile billboards need to keep up with the changing needs of advertisers and provide them with the data they already use and also data they demand. According to our study, there are several key factors that advertisers stated would increase their spending with a mobile billboard company: <ul> <li><b>Reliable Number of Impressions:</b> Advertisers want to go beyond ADT data and they want to know how many people actually saw their advertisement. </li> <li><b>Conversions:</b> Are the people who see the mobile billboard going into the advertiser’s store or onto their website?</li> <li><b>Demographics:</b> Rather than local advertisers providing the routes that they want the mobile billboard to traverse, they want the mobile billboard company to target the routes that will correlate the highest with their target customer demographics. </li></ul> <br> These findings correlate with what our clients have seen when using our product. Advertisers have increased their spends when our clients have presented them with relevant data. However, this should come as no surprise, because when the digital realm was able to provide click-through data online advertising took off.
