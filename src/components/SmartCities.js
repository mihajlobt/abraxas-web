                       ABRAXAS TECHNOLOGY is helping smart city initiatives with patent-pending technology that provides the ability
                        to understand visitors and residentsâ€™ movements throughout a city. Law enforcement will benefit with more information
                        in the event of a crime and cities will have more data to decrease congestion and increase pedestrian safety.

                    <h3 className="packages-headers">How It Works </h3>
                    <span>
                        Through our patent-pending Scout device and proprietary technology, ABRAXAS provides real-time visibility,
                        engagement, and resident and visitor data for smart city stakeholders. We offer installation services and provide
                        access into our network of devices that is already collecting smart city data across American cities.
